    <p>Story of EZRA: UZAIR: (2:259) Or consider him by way of example who passed by a town that was fallen
        down upon its turrets.293 He exclaimed: “How will Allah restore life to this town that
        is now dead?”294
        Allah then caused him to remain dead for a hundred years and then raised him to life,
        and asked him: “How long did you remain in this state?” He replied: “I remained so
        for a day or a part of a day.” Allah rejoined: “No, you have rather stayed thus for a
        hundred years. But look at your food and your drink, there is no deterioration in
        them. And look at your ass (how its entire skeleton has rotted)! And We did all this so
        that We might make you a token of instruction for people.295 And see how We will put
        the bones (of the ass) together and will clothe them with flesh.” Thus when the reality
        became clear to him, he said: “I know that Allah has power over everything.”</p>
