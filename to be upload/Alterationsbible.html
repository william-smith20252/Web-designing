    <br>
    <h1> CORRECTIONS OF ALTERATIONS IN THE TANAKH, ESV, CATHOLIC GOSPELS, SEPTUGINT, ORTHODOX CHRISTIANITY BIBLE IN THE
        LIGHT OF QURAN.</h1>
    <br>
    <h3>The intent of this document is to highlight every changes, alteration, revision etc in the holy Bible and to
        make corrections then all Bibles shall turn to the English version of the HOLY QURAN by someone who perfectly
        knows all the changes in the Holy bible. This will help every religious Authoritarian who is using ISRAELI
        HOLY LITERATURE after the non-sense alterations in the Holy Bible. Kindly look and see and Please start reading
        the HOLY QURAN AND IF POSSIBLE CONVERSION INTO ISLAM. Because your false alteration in the HOLY BIBLE shall
        definitely take you to the hell. I can Guarantee.</h3>
    <br>
    <h4>Note: If you are thinking about studying the QURAN then kindly study the english translations by the scholars of
        SAUDI ARABIA AND UNITED ARAB EMIRATES AND recommendations made by Dr. ZAKIR NAIK (THE FAMOUS MUSLIM SCHOLAR) and
        MUFTI MENK (THE FAMOUS MUSLIM SCHOLAR).</h4>
    <br>
    <h4> A SEPARATE RELIGION knowns as AHMADDIYA, or QADIAYANI, or LAHORI or MIRAZI's are NON-MUSLIM and they are
        deceiving people on the name of ISLAM. They have headquarter in HAIFA ISRAEL, RABWAH CHANAB NAGAR PUNJAB
        PROVINCE OF PAKISTAN AND QADIYAN PUNJAB STATE OF INDIA. SO BEWARE!! AND DO NOT STUDY THEIR MATERIAL BECAUSE THEY
        ARE NOT MUSLIMS. There english translation of holy quran written by there scholars Muhammad Ali, M.A., LL.B and
        Mirza Bashiruddin Mahmud Ahmad, and Sher 'Ali. They are using the muslim scholars titles like Maulana or
        Khalifatul Masih but they are actually bastards and they are not muslim religious scholars at all. SO BEWARE!!
        ONCE AGAIN.

        </p>
        <b> Conclusion: </b>
        <p> ALLAH don't need to see the things after creation becuase every thing is created according to the ALLAH word
            "kun" means be.
            <br>
        <p> <b>Allah said,
                “When He decrees a matter, He only says to it : “Be! ـ and it is.” thus, demonstrating His perfectly
                complete ability and tremendous authority; if He decides a matter, He merely orders it to, `Be’ and it
                comes into existence."</b> </p>
        <br>
        <p> Similarly, Allah said,

            <b>“Verily, His command, when He intends a thing, is only that He says to it, “Be! ـ and it is.” (36:82)
            </b>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p> <b>“Verily, Our Word unto a thing when We intend it, is only that We say unto it: “Be! ـ and it is.”

        <p> <b> “And Our commandment is but one as the twinkling of an eye” (54:50)</b> </p>
        <br>
        <p> So Allah informed us that He created Jesus by merely saying, “Be!” and he was, as Allah willed:
            <b> “Verily, the likeness of `Isa (Jesus) before Allah is the likeness of Adam. He created him from dust,

        <p> So above claim in the Tanakh, ESV, Catholic Gospels, SEPTUGINT and Orthodox bible is rejected. </p>
        <br>
        <p> <b>Interpretation of the meaning (Tafsir Ibn Kathir):</b> </p>
        <p>The Badi` (Originator) of the heavens and the earth.” – which means, He created them when nothing resembling
            them existed. He is the Owner of everything that is in the heavens and earth. All testify to His Oneness and
            to their submissiveness to Him. He is their Creator and Maker. Without created precedence, He shaped the
            creatures in their current shapes. Allah also bears witness to His servants that Jesus, who some claimed to
            be Allah’s son, is among those who testify to His Oneness. Allah stated that He created the heavens and
            earth out of nothing and without precedent. Likewise, He created Jesus, the Messiah, with His power and
            without a father.</p>

            He had made; and He rested on the seventh day
            from all His work which He had made." Is GOD a MASON working on wages?? or GOD is working on EPC

            employee??. And Why Seventh Day he rested?? Is GOD has family that
            he has to take them on the Park or on picnic?? Why?? </h3>
        </p>
        <b> Conclusion: </b>
        <p> The one and only Almighty Lord God ALLAH / Elohim has no Family. He one and only Almighty Lord God ALLAH /
            Elohim does not required to sleep. He one and only Almighty Lord God ALLAH / Elohim Does not need Rest. He
            one and only Almighty Lord God ALLAH / Elohim is not a HUMAN. Becuase he one and only Almighty Lord God

            <p> Lexically the word Riba means any increase, but the word is normally used for usury or interest payable
                on a loan. According to some exegetes, this word is used here in the technical sense. Some others are
                of the view that Riba in this verse is used for a gift offered to someone with intention to receive a
                greater gift from him in future. Both meanings are possible here. If the word is taken in the sense of
                usury or interest, the verse would mean that usurious transactions have no blessings from
                ALLAH/Eloha/YHWH, and it would contain an indication that they would be prohibited at a later stage.
                Then it was in Surah Al-imran (chapter of Family of Imran) and Surah Al-Baqarah (Chapter The cow) as
                mentioned above that it was prohibited in express term. </p>
