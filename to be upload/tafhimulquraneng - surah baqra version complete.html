    <p>Annulment: Sometimes marriages simply do not work out. While some couples seek to separate for a
        time hoping to one day resolve their issues and get back together, there are other instances where one
        or both spouses seek to officially end the marriage for the benefit of everyone involved. There are
        several different ways to end a marriage in the state of Ohio, including a divorce, dissolution of
        marriage, and an annulment or nullity of marriage.
        Marriage Annulment Definition
        In the state of Ohio, an annulment is where the court mandates that the marriage never took place as it
        officially terminates the union. Unlike a divorce, the annulment cannot be granted unless the reason for
        the termination falls under one of the qualifying grounds for nullification. These qualifying grounds for
        annulment are the outstanding circumstances used to determine if the marriage was never legally
        binding, was made under force, was made to commit fraud, or was never consummated. A marriage
        annulment essentially erases a marriage by declaring it null and void.
        Grounds for annulment in Ohio may include:
        One person was under the age to legally consent to marriage (females must be 16 while males must be
        18)
        Someone committed fraud to get the other person to marry them, such as giving a false identity or
        claiming a pregnancy
        Someone was not competent enough to agree to the marriage
        The other spouse was already legally married to another person who is still alive
        The marriage was forced under duress The marriage was never consummated by the spouses

        During a divorce, one or both spouses may seek to end the marriage at any point in their lives. This
        circumstance differs from an annulment as most grounds for the termination must be done within two
        years after the date of the marriage. In the case where one of the spouses was underage at the time, the
        marriage can be terminated within two years after the person reaches the legal age of getting married.
        If there was fraud committed to get one person to marry another, then the annulment must be
        requested two years after finding out the facts about the fraud.
        Yet the annulment will not be granted in most cases if both spouses lived together as husband and wife.
        So if you find out that your spouse committed fraud to marry you but you continued to live with them
        after this discovery, a court of law will not grant you an annulment. Additional circumstances where you
        won’t be given an annulment include if a person regained competency and both spouses continued to
        live together for a time, if you lived with the spouse after being forced to give your consent for the
        marriage, or you lived with your spouse even though you were underage at the time of marriage.

        An annulment is the cancellation of revocation of something, like a marriage. After an annulment, it's
        like the marriage never happened. The root nul (from Latin nullum) of this word is a good clue to its
        meaning: the underlying verb annul originally meant "reduce to nothing." An annulment also reduces
        something to nothing by canceling or terminating it, usually in a legal sense. The most common use of
        the term is the annulment of a marriage, which not only ends the marriage, but legally makes it as if the
        marriage never happened. Annulment is like a legal eraser. the act of abrogating; an official or legal
        cancellation. the state of being cancelled or annulled. (law) a formal termination (of a relationship or a
        judicial proceeding etc). the act of annulling, especially the formal declaration that annuls a marriage.
        Psychoanalysis. a mental process by which unpleasant or painful ideas are abolished from the mind. An
        annulment is a legal procedure that voids a marriage and declares it null from its inception.
        Unlike divorce, the effect of declaring a marriage void is retroactive, meaning that the marriage was void
        at the time it was entered into. It applies when an impediment to a legal marriage existed at the
        beginning of the marriage. An annulment is only granted with a showing of specific grounds, which may
        include: Fraud or coercion
        An undisclosed prior marriage
        Incest
        One or both parties were under the legal age to consent at the time of marriage, as defined by
        state statute
        Temporary insanity which existed at the time of marriage, so that the capacity to marry was not present
        because the person lacked an understanding of the duties and relationship of marriage.
        When a marriage ends, it's important to take the necessary legal steps to formally terminate the
        relationship. There are two ways to legally end a marriage—annulment and divorce. An annulment is a
        legal procedure that cancels a marriage. An annulled marriage is erased from a legal perspective, and it
        declares that the marriage never technically existed and was never valid.
        to officially announce that something such as a law, agreement, or marriage no longer exists:
        to announce officially a law, marriage, or other contract as no longer existing: to state officially that
        something such as a law, agreement, or marriage no longer exists: Annulment is a legal
        procedure within secular and religious legal systems for declaring a marriage null and
        void.[1] Unlike divorce, it is usually retroactive, meaning that an annulled marriage is considered to be
        invalid from the beginning almost as if it had never taken place (though some jurisdictions provide that
        the marriage is only void from the date of the annulment; for example, this is the case in section 12 of
        the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 in England and Wales).[2] In legal terminology, an annulment makes
        a void marriage or a voidable marriage null.[3] the act of stating officially that something, usually a
        marriage, is not legally recognized. What Is Annulment?
        Annulment is a legal process in which a marriage is declared to be null and void dating back to the time
        when it was entered into. A court has the power to grant an annulment, though there must be legal
        grounds for doing so. If a marriage is entered into fraudulently, for example, then one party may seek to
        have it annulled.1
        KEY TAKEAWAYS
        Annulment is a legal procedure for declaring a marriage null and void from its inception.
        For a court to grant an annulment, there must be legal grounds to justify it.
        If a couple is unable to obtain an annulment, then divorce may be the only legal option for ending the
        marriage.
        Getting a marriage annulled may relieve either party of court-imposed spousal support obligations.2
        American Bar Association. “Annulment.”
        Annulment, legal invalidation of a marriage. Annulment announces the invalidity of a marriage that was
        void from its inception. It is to be distinguished from dissolution, which ends a valid marriage for special
        reasons—e.g., insanity of one partner after marrying. The annulment decree attempts to leave the
        parties in statu quo ante (as they were before the marriage), unless doing so would adversely affect a
        third person.
        In secular law, only the government, through its courts, can invalidate a marriage; and generally only a
        party to the marriage can seek annulment. Christian canon law also has procedures for invalidating
        marriages.
        What does Annulment mean?
        A declaration of the court that a marriage was not legally valid or had become legally invalid.
        Unlike divorce or dissolution it is retroactive in that an annulled civil partnership or marriage is
        considered to be invalid from the beginning (as if it had never in fact taken place). Strictly, annulment
        refers only to making a voidable marriage or civil partnership null. If the marriage or civil partnership is
        void ab initio (ie void from the start) then it is automatically null although a legal declaration of nullity is
        still required.
        Separation When people are married or are in an ‘adult interdependent relationship’ end their relationship and
        begin living apart from each other, they are separated. There is no such thing as a ‘legal separation’ in
        Canada, but being separated for a year is one of the grounds for divorce.
        Adult interdependent relationship
        Any of these relationships is considered an ‘adult interdependent relationship’:
        interdependence with another adult for 3 years
        less than 3 years if you’ve signed an Adult Interdependent Partnership Agreement
        less than 3 years if you have had a biological child together
        If people in an adult interdependent relationship are separated for 1 year, their relationship is officially
        considered to have ended. Partners of an adult independent relationship may also end their relationship
        by an agreement.
        Separation agreements
        A separation agreement is a contract between parties who are separating or divorcing. These usually
        deal with issues such as:
        where your children will live and what time periods they will spend with the other parent
        how much child support will be paid
        how much spousal support will be paid
        how property is divided
        It is possible for you and your former spouse or partner to write an agreement yourselves, but it is
        recommended that you speak to a lawyer.
        Annulment
        An annulment is a court order that says that your marriage did not exist or was not valid – this is
        different from a divorce, which ends a valid marriage that previously existed. When a marriage is
        annulled, it ends immediately.
        Annulments are only possible to obtain in rare situations such as:
        your spouse was already married to another person when they married you
        you married the person only because someone threatened your physical safety
        you were impaired by drugs or alcohol to the point that you did not understand you were going through
        the marriage ceremony
        you thought you were marrying one person, but it was actually another person
        if the person you married is unable to consummate the marriage
        if you were under the age of 18 at the time of the marriage, you did not have your parent’s consent, and
        you did not consummate the marriage
        Sometimes a church or other religious institution might grant an annulment. This is different from a
        legal annulment.
        You will need to speak with a lawyer to discuss an annulment.
        An annulment (or nullity) is when a judge says in a court order that your marriage or domestic
        partnership is not legally valid. This means something was legally wrong with the marriage from the
        start. If you get an annulment, it’s like your marriage never happened because it was never legal. You
        must give a reason why your marriage wasn't legal from the start
        A judge can only annul a marriage for a specific legal reason. A few examples
        One of the spouses is married to another person (bigamy)
        You got married when you were under 18 and it wasn't legal to do so
        Your spouse tricked you to get you to agree to marry them
        A very short marriage is not a legal reason for an annulment. There are at least 8 legal reasons a judge
        can annul a marriage.
        Even if you and your spouse agree to the annulment, you will have to go in front of a judge to explain
        why your marriage was never legal to begin with. An annulment is a legal procedure through which a marriage
        between two people is deemed null and
        void. In the eyes of the law, it is as if they were never married in the first place. As such, there are often
        fewer concerns, such as division of property, to worry about, allowing the marriage dissolution to occur
        quickly. Annulment is a legal procedure within secular and religious legal systems for declaring a
        marriage null and void. Unlike divorce, it is usually retroactive, meaning that an annulled marriage is
        considered to be invalid from the beginning almost as if it had never taken place (though some
        jurisdictions provide that the marriage is only void from the date of the annulment; for example, this is
        the case in section 12 of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 in England and Wales). In legal terminology,
        an annulment makes a void marriage or a voidable marriage null. When you can annul a marriage
        Annulment (sometimes known as ‘nullity’) is a different way of ending a marriage.
        Unlike divorce, you can apply for annulment in the first year of your marriage or any time after.
        However, if you apply years after the wedding, you might be asked to explain the delay.
        You’ll need to show that the marriage:
        was never legally valid (‘void’)
        was legally valid, but meets one of the reasons that makes it ‘voidable’
        Your marriage is not legally valid - ‘void’ marriages
        You can annul a marriage if it was not legally valid in the first place, for example:
        you’re closely related to the person you married
        one or both of you were under 18 (or under 16 if the marriage took place before 27 February 2023)
        one of you was already married or in a civil partnership
        If a marriage was never legally valid, the law says that it never existed.
        However, you may need legal paperwork (a ‘decree of nullity’ or ‘nullity of marriage order’) to prove this
        - for example if you want to get married again.
        Your marriage is ‘voidable’
        You can annul a marriage for a number of reasons, such as:
        it was not consummated - you have not had sexual intercourse with the person you married since the
        wedding (does not apply for same sex couples)
        you did not properly consent to the marriage - for example you were forced into it
        the other person had a sexually transmitted disease (STD) when you got married
        your spouse was pregnant by someone else when you got married
        one spouse is in the process of transitioning to a different gender
        As with divorce, your marriage legally exists until you annul it using one of these reasons.
        The rules on ending a civil partnership are slightly different, but the court forms are the same.
        What is an annulment?
        An annulment is a court ruling that a marriage was never valid. The most common ground for
        annulment is fraud and misrepresentation. For example, one person may not have disclosed to the
        other a prior divorce, a criminal record, an infectious disease, or an inability to engage in sex or have
        children. Annulment may also be granted in cases involving bigamy, incest, or marriage to an underage
        person.
        How common are annulments?
        Very uncommon; divorces are generally easier to obtain, and the basis for annulment is narrower than
        the basis for divorce. However, one party may prefer an annulment in order to avoid some obligations
        that a court might impose in a divorce. Also, in a few states, spousal support that terminated because of
        the recipient’s second marriage may be reinstated if the second marriage is annulled.
        What's the difference between divorce and annulment?
        Just like a divorce, an annulment brings your marriage to an end. However, whilst a divorce dissolves
        your marriage, an annulment of marriage means that in the eyes of the law, the marriage never took
        place.Why are divorce and annulment two separate things?
        An annulment is a legal procedure that ends a marriage by declaring it null and void. It can be granted if
        a marriage is deemed to be either defective or was never valid in the first place. That's why, if you are
        able to establish that your marriage to your partner was never legal, then in the eyes of the law, it is as
        though it didn't happen.
        In contrast, a divorce doesn't bring into question the legal validity of a marriage; instead, it is the legal
        dissolution of a marriage. Unlike an annulment - which you can get at any time after your wedding - you
        have to be married for a year before you can apply for a divorce.

    <p>Amicably: in a friendly and peaceable manner. without arguments, legal action,
        or unpleasant behaviour: in a pleasant and friendly way: with goodwill; in a friendly or peaceable way: in
        a polite and friendly way. When you do something amicably, you're doing it politely and nicely. It's best
        to deal with traffic cops and waiters amicably.
        This word for doing things in a pleasant manner is often used in not so amicable situations. Let's say a
        couple gets divorced — if they parted amicably, then there wasn't a lot of yelling and screaming, and
        they both agreed to it. You could say two countries that dislike each other had a meeting of their leaders
        that was conducted amicably: they were polite and said nice things, even though that's not necessarily
        how they felt. in an amicable manner. Dostana tor par. Dostana andaz main. Piyar mohabbat se.

    <p>Amicable: relating to behaviour between people that is pleasant and friendly,
        often despite a difficult situation: relating to an agreement or decision that
        is achieved without people arguing or being unpleasant: friendly in attitude, or
        (of decisions or agreements) achieved with friendly attitudes and without unpleasant argument:
        pleasant and friendly, often despite a difficult situation: an
        amicable agreement is achieved without arguments or anger: characterized by
        friendly goodwill : PEACEABLE. When people have an amicable relationship, they are pleasant to each
        other and solve their problems without quarrelling. Synonyms: friendly, kindly, brotherly, civil.
        Characterized by friendliness. friendly in feeling; showing good will; peaceable. characterized by or
        showing goodwill; friendly; peaceable. done or achieved in a polite or friendly way and without arguing.
        The adjective amicable means "friendly" — but in particular, use it when describing relations one might
        otherwise expect to be unfriendly. The end of a romantic relationship that's less than amicable might
        involve broken dishes or broken bones.
        Amicable, not surprisingly, comes from the Latin word for "friend," amicus. Perhaps the things most
        commonly described as amicable are divorces. The parties in a divorce often tend to be so childish and
        the proceedings so messy that it's nice to have a word that reflects the absence of those qualities. Other
        nouns that commonly pair with amicable include relationship, split, parting, solution, and breakup.
        characterized by friendship and good will.

    <br>
    <p>Adamant in classical mythology is an archaic form of diamond. In fact, the English word diamond is ultimately
        derived from adamas, via Late Latin diamas and Old French diamant. In ancient Greek ἀδάμας (adamas), genitive
        ἀδάμαντος (adamantos), literally 'unconquerable, untameable'. In those days, the qualities of hard metal
        (probably steel) were attributed to it, and adamant became as a result an independent concept.

        In the Middle Ages adamant also became confused with the magnetic rock lodestone, and a folk etymology connected
        it with the Latin adamare, 'to love or be attached to'.[1] Another connection was the belief that adamant (the
        diamond definition) could block the effects of a magnet. This was addressed in chapter III of Pseudodoxia
        Epidemica, for instance.

        Since the contemporary word diamond is now used for the hardest gemstone, the increasingly archaic noun adamant
        has been reduced to mostly poetic or anachronistic use. In that capacity, the name, and various derivatives of
        it, are frequently used in modern media to refer to a variety of fictional substances.</p>
    <br>
    <p>In mythology: Adamant is used as a translation in the King James Bible in Ezekiel 3:9 for the word שמיר(Shamir),
        the original word in the Hebrew Bible.</p>

    <p>The word adamant has appeared in 166 articles on NYTimes.com in the past year, including on Dec. 30 in “Creating
        the Exiled Sea Creature of ‘Avatar: The Way of Water’” by Carlos Aguilar:

        The first fact you must accept about the tulkun, the marine species introduced in “Avatar: The Way of Water,” is
        that they aren’t whales. The director James Cameron is adamant about this.

        “I nearly got through the whole film without calling it a whale in front of Jim,” said Dan Barrett, who served
        as senior animation supervisor on the film as part of Weta FX, the famed visual effects company based in
        Wellington, New Zealand. “I did once, and you were immediately corrected.” </p>

    <p>To arrogate is to take over. When the teacher steps out of the classroom and some bossy student marches up to the
        front of the class and begins scolding the other kids? The student is trying to arrogate the teacher's
        authority.

        When someone takes control of something, often without permission, such as when a military general assumes the
        power of a country's government after getting rid of the previous leader, they arrogate power or control to
        themselves. Occasionally the verb arrogate means something like "assert one's right to," or take something that
        is deserved, but more often it implies a taking by force. to take something without having the right to do so:

    <p>An acquaintance is someone you know a little about, but they’re not your best friend or anything. Acquaintance is
        also having knowledge about something specific, like horror films or the farming techniques of Chinese peasants.

        The root of acquaintance is the Old French word acointier, a verb meaning “make known.” Being the acquaintance
        of a person or topic means that you know something about it. An acquaintance is less intimate than a friend,
        like a person in your class whose name you know, but that’s it. When you “make the acquaintance of” someone, you
        meet them for the first time. If you know nothing about eggplants, you’d say, “I have little acquaintance with
        eggplants.”</p>

    <p>To atone is to do something "right" to make up for doing something wrong. Religious believers are known to atone
        for their sins, but even students can atone for a past failure by acing a quiz or two.

        The word atone came to English as a contraction of the words at and one. The verb means to make amends or
        reparations for an offense or wrong doing. You can remember the meaning by thinking of it as a sort of Zen
        concept, to be "at one" or in harmony with someone, you have to atone for your mistakes and be forgiven. In a
        religious sense, it means to repent for sins ("to atone for his sins").</p>

    <br>
    <p><strong> Medical definition: </strong> lack of feeling or of interest. Apathy is a lack of feeling, emotion,
        interest, or concern about something. It is a state of indifference, or the suppression of emotions such as
        concern, excitement, motivation, or passion. An apathetic individual has an absence of interest in or concern
        about emotional, social, spiritual, philosophical, virtual, or physical life and the world. Apathy can also be
        defined as a person's lack of goal orientation.[2] Apathy falls in the less extreme spectrum of diminished
        motivation, with abulia in the middle and akinetic mutism being more extreme than both apathy and abulia.[3]

        The apathetic may lack a sense of purpose, worth, or meaning in their life. People with severe apathy tend to
        have a lower quality of life and are at a higher risk for mortality and early institutionalization.[2] They may
        also exhibit insensibility or sluggishness.[4] In positive psychology, apathy is described as a result of the
        individuals' feeling they do not possess the level of skill required to confront a challenge (i.e. "flow"). It
        may also be a result of perceiving no challenge at all (e.g., the challenge is irrelevant to them, or
        conversely, they have learned helplessness). Apathy is usually felt only in the short term, but sometimes it
        becomes a long-term or even lifelong state, often leading to deeper social and psychological issues.[medical
        citation needed]

        Apathy should be distinguished from reduced affect display, which refers to reduced emotional expression but not
        necessarily reduced emotion.

        Pathological apathy, characterized by extreme forms of apathy, is now known to occur in many different brain
        disorders,[5] including neurodegenerative conditions often associated with dementia such as Alzheimer's
        disease,[6] Parkinson's disease,[7] and psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia.[8] Although many patients
        with pathological apathy also have depression, several studies have shown that the two syndromes are
        dissociable: apathy can occur independent of depression and vice versa.[5] Although the word apathy was first
        used in 1594[9] and is derived from the Greek ἀπάθεια (apatheia), from ἀπάθης (apathēs, "without feeling" from
        a- ("without, not") and pathos ("emotion")),[10] it is important not to confuse the two terms. Also meaning
        "absence of passion," "apathy" or "insensibility" in Greek, the term apatheia was used by the Stoics to signify
        a (desirable) state of indifference toward events and things that lie outside one's control (that is, according
        to their philosophy, all things exterior, one being only responsible for one's own representations and
        judgments).[11] In contrast to apathy, apatheia is considered a virtue, especially in Orthodox monasticism.[12]
        In the Philokalia the word dispassion is used for apatheia, so as not to confuse it with apathy. </p>
    <br>
    <p> Christians have historically condemned apathy as a deficiency of love and devotion to God and his works.[14]
        This interpretation of apathy is also referred to as Sloth and is listed among the Seven Deadly Sins. Clemens
        Alexandrinus used the term to draw to gnostic Christianity philosophers who aspired after virtue.[citation
        needed][15]

        The modern concept of apathy became more well known after World War I, when it was one of the various forms of
        "shell shock".[16] Soldiers who lived in the trenches amidst the bombing and machine gun fire, and who saw the
        battlefields strewn with dead and maimed comrades, developed a sense of disconnected numbness and indifference
        to normal social interaction when they returned from combat.

        In 1950, US novelist John Dos Passos wrote: "Apathy is one of the characteristic responses of any living
        organism when it is subjected to stimuli too intense or too complicated to cope with. The cure for apathy is
        comprehension." </p>
    <br>
    <p> Social origin
        There may be other factors contributing to a person's apathy.

        Apathy has been socially viewed as worse than things such as hate or anger. Not caring whatsoever, in the eyes
        of some, is even worse than having distaste for something. Author Leo Buscaglia is quoted as saying "I have a
        very strong feeling that the opposite of love is not hate-it's apathy. It's not giving a damn."[18] Helen Keller
        stated that apathy is the "worst of them all" when it comes to the various evils in the world.[19] French social
        commentator and political thinker Charles de Montesquieu stated that "the tyranny of a prince in an oligarchy is
        not so dangerous to the public welfare as the apathy of a citizen in the democracy." As can be seen by these
        quotes and various others, the social implications of apathy are great. Many people believe that not caring at
        all can be worse for society than individuals who are overpowering or hateful. </p>

        Beneficence is defined as an act of charity, mercy, and kindness with a strong connotation of doing good
        to others including moral obligation. All professionals have the foundational moral imperative of doing
        right. In the context of the professional-client relationship, the professional is obligated to, always and
        without exception, favor the well-being and interest of the client. In health care, beneficence is one of
        the fundamental ethics. An integral part of work as a professional is the foundational ethic of
        beneficence. An understanding of this ethic of care compels the individual health practitioner to
        consider his or her calling to the high standards of professionalism as a moral imperative; one that
        advocates for high standards and strives for the greater good. The generic definition of beneficence is an
        act of charity, mercy, and kindness. It connotes doing good to others and invokes a wide array of moral
        obligations. Beneficent acts can be performed from a position of obligation in what is owed and from a
        supererogatory perspective, meaning more than what is owed. An example of this is what has become known as a
        random act of kindness. Faida, Karam Farmai, Naiki, Meharbani, Ehsaan, kisi ki madad karna,

    <p>Connote / connotation:
        an idea or feeling which a word invokes for a person in addition to its literal or primary meaning.
        PHILOSOPHY
        The abstract meaning or intension of a term, which forms a principle determining which objects or
        concepts it applies to. The act of connoting; the suggesting of an additional meaning for a word or
        expression, apart from its explicit meaning
        If a word connotes something, it makes you think of qualities and ideas that are more than
        its basic meaning → denote. Connote something (of a word) to suggest a feeling, an idea, etc. as well as
        the main meaning. To make you think about (something) in addition to the word's meaning. to signify
        or suggest (certain meanings, ideas, etc.) in addition to the explicit or primary meaning: to convey in
        addition to exact explicit meaning. To mark along with; to suggest or indicate as additional; to designate
        by implication; to include in the meaning; to imply. To signify or suggest (certain meanings, ideas, etc.) in

        Meaning of Connotation is a secondary word used to express an idea, qualities or feeling
        in association to its literal meaning. Connotation describes the primary word and it does not need to be
        a part of the meaning of word or phrase. It generally has an emotional connection which can be positive
        or negative. A rich vocabulary enables you to choose the right words to express yourself. Choosing the
        right words is important because although two words may have the same meaning, their connotations
        may differ. Connotations are perceptions or feelings a word conveys, which are distinct from the actual
        meaning of the words. For instance, there may be words that have the same meaning, but different perceptions. A
        connotation is a commonly understood cultural or emotional association that any given
        word or phrase carries, in addition to its explicit or literal meaning, which is its denotation.
        A connotation is frequently described as either positive or negative, with regard to its pleasing or
        displeasing emotional connection.
        The connotation meaning can be traced back to the beginning of linguistics and semiotics. Connotation
        is simply anytime anything is regarded as something other than its literal textbook definition.
        A connotation is a non-literal framing of a term that intends to add an association beyond its literal
        meaning. Connotations can have negative, neutral or positive implications on a term. Take happiness as
        the neutral for example: the negative connotation of happiness could be mania and the positive
        connotation could be vibrancy.</p>

        Chauvinism means the belief that your country is superior to all others. If you traveled to China and

        your country is vastly better than any other, the word is most familiar in the sense of male chauvinism.
        When it's used this way, it means a belief that men are better than women. The word comes from a
        Napoleonic soldier, Nicholas Chauvin, who was famous for his extreme patriotism — in other words,
        his chauvinism. Mard ki baladasti, jununi watan parasti, qoum parasti. Nasal parast, Devotion to a sect

        The Overlap of Cults and Culture
        Cult, which shares an origin with culture and cultivate, comes from the Latin cultus, a noun with
        meanings ranging from "tilling, cultivation" to "training or education" to "adoration." In English, cult has
        evolved a number of meanings following a fairly logical path. The earliest known uses of the word,
        recorded in the 17th century, broadly denoted "worship." From here cult came to refer to a specific
        branch of a religion or the rites and practices of that branch, as in "the cult of Dionysus." By the early
        18th century, cult could refer to a non-religious admiration or devotion, such as to a person, idea, or fad
        ("the cult of success"). Finally, by the 19th century, the word came to be used of "a religion regarded as
        unorthodox or spurious." Cult is a term, in most contexts pejorative, for a relatively small group which is
        typically led by a charismatic and self-appointed leader, who excessively controls its members, requiring
        unwavering devotion to a set of beliefs and practices which are considered deviant (outside the norms
        of society). This term is also used for a new religious movement or other social group which is defined by
        its unusual religious, spiritual, or philosophical beliefs and rituals, or its common interest in a particular
        person, object, or goal. This sense of the term is weakly defined – having divergent definitions both
        in popular culture and academia – and has also been an ongoing source of contention among scholars
        across several fields of study.
        An older sense of the word involves a set of religious devotional practices that is conventional within its
        culture, is related to a particular figure, and is frequently associated with a particular place. Ideological
        or school of tought such as orthodox or reformed. Fiqah. Firqa, Mazhabi o deeni Tanzeem, Mazhabi o

    <p>Copts: Copts (Coptic: ⲛⲓⲣⲉⲙⲛ̀ⲭⲏⲙⲓ, romanized: niremənkhēmi; Arabic: ا لْ قْ بْط , romanized: al-qibṭ) are
        a Christian ethnoreligious group indigenous to North Africa who have primarily inhabited the area of
        modern Egypt and Sudan since antiquity. Most ethnic Copts are Coptic Oriental Orthodox Christians.
        They are the largest Christian denomination in Egypt and the Middle East, as well as in
        Sudan and Libya. Copts have historically spoken the Coptic language, a direct descendant of the Demotic
        Egyptian that was spoken in late antiquity. The English language adopted the word Copt in the 17th
        century from Neo-Latin Coptus, Cophtus, which derives from the Arabic collective qubṭ / qibṭ قبط "the
        Copts" with nisba adjective qubṭī, qibṭī قبطى , plural aqbāṭ أقباط ; Also quftī, qiftī (where the Arabic /f/
        reflects the historical Coptic /p/) an Arabisation of the Coptic word
        ⲁⲓⲅⲩⲡⲧⲓⲟⲛ aiguption (Bohairic) or ⲕⲩⲡⲧⲁⲓⲟⲛ kuptaion (Sahidic). The Coptic word in turn represents an
        adaptation of the Greek term for the indigenous people of Egypt, Aigýptios (Αἰγύπτιος). Copt, a member
        of Egypt’s indigenous Christian ethno-religious community. The terms Copt and Coptic are variously
        used to denote either the members of the Coptic Orthodox Church, the largest Christian body in Egypt,
        or as generic terms for Egyptian Christians; this article focuses primarily on the former definition.
        Copts constitute up to 10 percent of the population of Egypt. The Copts are descendants of pre-Islamic
        Egyptians, who spoke a late form of the Egyptian language known as Coptic. Such a descendant was
        identified in Greek as A Aigyptios (Arabic qibṭ, Westernized as Copt). When Egyptian Muslims later
        ceased to call themselves by the demonym, the term became the distinctive name of the Christian
        minority. After Copts began converting to Roman Catholicism (see also Coptic Catholic Church) and
        Protestant sects, Copts of the Oriental Orthodox communion began to call themselves Coptic Orthodox
        to distinguish themselves from other Christians of Coptic background. A native Egyptian in the

        In Islam, Taqiya or Taqiyya (Arabic: تقیة taqīyah, literally "prudence, fear")is a precautionary dissimulation
        or denial of religious belief and practice. Generally, taqiya is the action of committing a sinful act (such
        as feigning unbelief) for a pious goal.
        Hiding one’s beliefs under compulsion is common in many societies and religions. It has been a feature
        of Islam since its earliest days, and is acknowledged by Muslims of virtually all persuasions. However,
        the use of Taqiyyah varies, especially between Sunni and Shia Muslims. Sunni Muslims gained political
        supremacy over time and therefore only occasionally found the need to practice Taqiyyah. On the other
        hand, the minority Shiah community developed taqiyyah as an instinctive method of self-preservation
        and protection in hostile environments.
        A related term is Kitmān (lit. "action of covering, dissimulation"), which has a more specific meaning of
        dissimulation by silence or omission.</p>

    <p><strong>creaturely:</strong>of, pertaining to, or of the nature of a creature. Characteristic of or suitable to a

    <br>
    <p><strong>creatureliness:</strong>The state or quality of being creaturely.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Our creatureliness dictates that we must live according to the design of the Creator. God designed us to be
        happy, to do His will, and to one day be with Him forever in Paradise. Without a doubt, God wants us to grow in
        our wisdom and knowledge of Him. He wants us to love one another. He wants us to be fruitful and multiply. But
        more than anything else, God wants us to believe in His Son Jesus, and He wants us to walk in His footsteps and
        follow His commands.

        But our creatureliness demands something else. We must accept our limitations. We have both physical and
        spiritual limitations. Physically speaking we must make time to eat, sleep and maintain our health. Spiritually
        speaking we are limited by the evil Jesus speaks of in Mark 7:1-23 that comes from within us.

        From the very beginning of human existence mankind has rebelled against our dependence on God. Even though we
        are the created, we have sought to be the creator. Humans have always tried to reject the idea of being limited.
        In the story of Adam and Eve contained in Genesis 2:4 to 3:24, we see that God granted them great freedom, but
        directed them not to eat from the Tree of Knowledge. The serpent told Eve, “God knows well that when you eat of
        it your eyes will be opened and you will be like gods, who know good and evil.” Of course, we all know the rest
        of the story. Both Adam and Eve ate from the tree. Essentially, they attempted to reject their creatureliness in
        order to become gods. This is the very essence of sin!

        Seeking more control and power never gives us peace. Try as we may, we cannot escape the limitations of our
        creatureliness. Any attempt to free ourselves from our human limitations and any attempt to deny the evil that
        is within us, only serves to further enslave us.

        As children of God, we don’t like to admit our evil and sinful side. To be clear, even long after we have
        accepted Jesus as our Savior, we still remain sinful people. Yes, it is true that we become new creatures in
        Christ, however we still have our limitations and flaws. The only way to avoid having our creaturely limitations
        would be to become god. Adam and Eve tried that. It didn’t work. God alone is God! Yes, it is true that we are
        made in God’s image, but sin has greatly distorted that image. That image has been defiled by our evil thoughts,
        unchastity, theft, murder, adultery, greed, malice, deceit, licentiousness, envy, blasphemy, arrogance, folly
        and so much more.

        So, what must we do? We must learn to both accept and embrace the limitations of our creatureliness. We can
        bring glory to God by accepting our utter dependence on Him. He is the source of our life and being and Jesus
        alone is the source of our salvation and Eternal Life.

        Death is a constant reminder that we are creatures, but through Jesus Christ, death has lost its sting. We can
        often get worn down by our propensity to sin. Just like St. Paul had his thorn, we are all weak and limited. In
        order to have peace, joy, and happiness, we must accept our weaknesses. Yes, we must work to improve, but in the
        end, we must place ourselves at the foot of the cross. We must place our trust in Jesus Christ who has paid the
        ultimate price for our shortcomings and have faith that one day we will be freed from this mortal existence.
        Thus, to fully understand God and His Holiness, we must first come to an understanding and acceptance of our
        creatureliness.

    <p> <strong> causation: </strong> the action of causing something. the relationship between cause and effect;
        causality. the process of causing something to happen or exist. If you’ve been searching for information online
        after an injury, you’ve probably seen the term ‘causation’ used in reference to personal injury law. You can get
        the basic idea of the word’s meaning from the root ‘cause,’ and from its context, but legal terms have very
        specific definitions. So let’s take a deeper look at the answer to the question: “What is causation in law?”. In
        legal terms, causation refers to the relationship of cause and effect between one event or action and the
        result. It is the act or process that produces an effect.

        In a personal injury case, you must establish causation—meaning that it’s not enough to show that the defendant
        was negligent. The negligence must be what caused the complainant’s injuries. Causation essentially means proof
        of negligence, which must be proven in two ways. Causation in negligence can be hard to determine because every
        negligence case is subjective. Causation is not always obvious, so there needs to be legal parameters to follow
        to determine the cause of the negligence.

        Because of the nuances, it’s important to work with an experienced attorney who understands both parts of
        causation. There are two facets to the causation definition:

        Cause-in-fact
        Proximate cause
        Causation applies to both criminal law and tort law; causation tort law will look different than criminal cases,
        as each case varies; but causation still needs to be proven through evidence.

        Both parts of causation address the fact and nuance of situations where causation must be determined. In order
        to win a case, the victim needs to prove both types of causation. They are also both essential elements of a
        wrongful death case.

        CAUSE-IN-FACT CAUSATION DEFINITION
        Cause-in-fact—also referred to as factual causation or actual cause—is the actual evidence, or facts of the
        case, that prove a party is at fault for causing the other person’s harm, damages, or losses.

        Cause-in-fact seeks to answer a question to the “but-for” test. The “but-for” test asks if the victim was
        harmed, was that harm directly caused by the defendant’s actions? Another way to think about it is like this:
        But for the existence of ABC, would XYZ have happened?

        Regarding intent, if the defendant did cause the harm, it does not matter whether or not they intended to.
        Sometimes bad things happen regardless of a defendant’s motivation. Essentially, this type of causation lays out
        all of the facts of the case and who is responsible for each step of the event that caused harm.

        PROXIMATE CAUSATION DEFINITION
        Unlike the fact-based timeline of factual causation, proximate causation is a trickier legal concept. This is
        because, technically, there is no clear definition, as it involves many moving parts.

        Proximate causation is about opinions and options that are not necessarily rooted in fact (cause-in-fact), but
        rather about finding out whether or not the injury would have occurred without the proximate cause.

        Proximate causation asks the question:

        Is it reasonable that the defendant knew their actions could and would cause harm?

        Proximate causation needs to be a direct cause of the harm that was done. It cannot be anything coincidental or
        abnormal. It also cannot be foreseeable.

        This may seem simple—like in drunk driving cases—but it is far from it. For example, if a person was intoxicated
        and drove, hitting someone, the driver should have reasonably foreseen that driving drunk can cause accidents to
        another person. However, cases ever so straightforward.

        Suppose someone slips on ice outside of a store that should have had an employee clear their walkway. As the
        individual who slipped still lies on the ground, a car swerves off of the road onto the sidewalk and hits them,
        causing traumatic brain injury. The store could not have anticipated that a car would swerve off the road at the
        same time that their lack of shoveling caused someone to slip.

        Example of Causation in Negligence
        Suppose a homeowner leaves the gate surrounding their backyard pool unlocked. A child opens the gate, falls into
        the pool, and drowns. The homeowner’s negligent action caused the accident; therefore, causation could be
        established.

        However, if a child climbed over the fence at the other end of the pool, fell into the pool and drowned, the
        homeowner would not be liable. Although there was negligence in both examples, the negligence in this case did
        not cause the child’s accident. The accident would have happened even if the gate had been locked.

        As you can see, the facts, intentions, and awareness of possible harm all matter. They can also be difficult to
        determine. Because of the law of causation, it is important to work with a knowledgeable attorney who can build
        a strong case for both factual and proximate causation.

        If you have been injured, it may be obvious to you who is at fault. Yet, all cases come with their own nuances
        and can get complicated quickly. Talk to the attorneys at WKW today so that we can work towards getting you the

    <p> Have you noticed how so many of the best TV shows concentrate on a group of friends who seem to mesh together
        perfectly, to the exclusion of all others? This, then, is a coterie, an exclusive group with common interests.

        The modern spelling and meaning of coterie developed in the 18th century from a French word rooted in the feudal
        system. When the farmers working the land of a feudal lord established an organization, they were called
        cotiers, or "tenants of a cote" (think "cottage"), and that idea of a select group led to the word coterie.
        There's just something so French about the idea of exclusivity, isn't there?</p>

        This adjective is usually followed by the preposition to, and it refers to bringing about something favorable or

        Latin conducere, from the prefix com- "together" plus ducere "to lead." And the suffix –ive means "tending to."

        terrible weather. Clement first appeared in the 13th century as a surname, or last name, from the Latin
        clementem, "mild or placid," and was used to describe nice weather by the 17th century.</p>

    <p> <strong> ECONOMICS: </strong> <b> Commodity: </b> In economics, a commodity is an economic good, usually a
        resource, that specifically has full or substantial fungibility: that is, the market treats instances of the
        good as equivalent or nearly so with no regard to who produced them.

        The price of a commodity good is typically determined as a function of its market as a whole: well-established
        physical commodities have actively traded spot and derivative markets. The wide availability of commodities
        typically leads to smaller profit margins and diminishes the importance of factors (such as brand name) other
        than price.

        Most commodities are raw materials, basic resources, agricultural, or mining products, such as iron ore, sugar,
        or grains like rice and wheat. Commodities can also be mass-produced unspecialized products such as chemicals
        and computer memory. Popular commodities include crude oil, corn, and gold.

        Other definitions of commodity include something useful or valued[4] and an alternative term for an economic
        good or service available for purchase in the market.In such standard works as Alfred Marshall's Principles
        of Economics (1920) and Léon Walras's Elements of Pure Economics ([1926] 1954)'commodity' serves as
        general term for an economic good or service. The word commodity came into use in English in the 15th century,
        from the French commodité, "amenity, convenience". Going further back, the French word derives from the Latin
        commoditas, meaning "suitability, convenience, advantage". The Latin word commodus (from which English gets
        other words including commodious and accommodate) meant variously "appropriate", "proper measure, time, or
        condition", and "advantage, benefit". Characteristics
        In economics, the term commodity is used specifically for economic goods that have full or partial but
        substantial fungibility; that is, the market treats their instances as equivalent or nearly so with no regard to
        who produced them.[1] Karl Marx described this property as follows: "From the taste of wheat, it is not possible
        to tell who produced it, a Russian serf, a French peasant or an English capitalist."[8] Petroleum and copper are
        examples of commodity goods:[9] their supply and demand are a part of one universal market.

        Non-commodity items such as stereo systems have many aspects of product differentiation, such as the brand, the
        user interface and the perceived quality. The demand for one type of stereo may be much larger than demand for
        another.

        The price of a commodity good is typically determined as a function of its market as a whole. Well-established
        physical commodities have actively traded spot and derivative markets. Hard and soft commodities

        World exports of cereals by main commodities
        Soft commodities are goods that are grown, such as wheat, or rice.

        Hard commodities are mined. Examples include gold, silver, helium, and oil.

        Energy commodities include electricity, gas, coal and oil. Electricity has the particular characteristic that it
        is usually uneconomical to store, and must therefore be consumed as soon as it is produced. Commoditization
        Commoditization occurs as a goods or services market loses differentiation across its supply base, often by the
        diffusion of the intellectual capital necessary to acquire or produce it efficiently. As such, goods that
        formerly carried premium margins for market participants have become commodities, such as generic
        pharmaceuticals and DRAM chips. An article in The New York Times cites multivitamin supplements as an example of
        commoditization; a 50 mg tablet of calcium is of equal value to a consumer no matter what company produces and
        markets it, and as such, multivitamins are now sold in bulk and are available at any supermarket with little
        brand differentiation.[10] Following this trend, nanomaterials are emerging from carrying premium profit margins
        for market participants to a status of commodification.[11]

        There is a spectrum of commoditization, rather than a binary distinction of "commodity versus differentiable
        product". Few products have complete undifferentiability and hence fungibility; even electricity can be
        differentiated in the market based on its method of generation (e.g., fossil fuel, wind, solar), in markets
        where energy choice lets a buyer opt (and pay more) for renewable methods if desired. Many products' degree of
        commoditization depends on the buyer's mentality and means. For example, milk, eggs, and notebook paper are not
        differentiated by many customers; for them, the product is fungible and lowest price is the main decisive factor

        Main articles: Futures exchange and Commodity market
        In the original and simplified sense, commodities were things of value, of uniform quality, that were produced
        in large quantities by many different producers; the items from each different producer were considered
        equivalent. On a commodity exchange, it is the underlying standard stated in the contract that defines the
        commodity, not any quality inherent in a specific producer's product.

        Commodities exchanges include:

        Markets for trading commodities can be very efficient, particularly if the division into pools matches demand
        segments. These markets will quickly respond to changes in supply and demand to find an equilibrium price and
        quantity. In addition, investors can gain passive exposure to the commodity markets through a commodity price
        index.

        In order to diversify their investments and mitigate the risks associated with inflationary debasement of
        currencies, pension funds and sovereign wealth funds allocate capital to non-listed assets such as a commodities
        and commodity-related infrastructure.[13]

        Inventory data
        The inventory of commodities, with low inventories typically leading to more volatile future prices and
        increasing the risk of a "stockout" (inventory exhaustion). According to economist theorists, companies receive
        a convenience yield by holding inventories of certain commodities. Data on inventories of commodities are not
        available from one common source, although data is available from various sources. Inventory data on 31
        commodities was used in a 2006 study on the relationship between inventories and commodity futures risk
        premiums.[14]

        Commodification of labour
        See also: Labour is not a commodity
        In classical political economy and especially in Karl Marx's critique of political economy, a commodity is an
        object or a good or service ("product" or "activity"[15]) produced by human labour.[16] Objects are external to
        man.[17] However, some objects attain "use value" to persons in this world, when they are found to be
        "necessary, useful or pleasant in life".[18] "Use value" makes an object "an object of human wants",[19] or "a
        means of subsistence in the widest sense".[20]

        As society developed, people found that they could trade goods and services for other goods and services. At
        this stage, these goods and services became "commodities". According to Marx, commodities are defined as objects
        which are offered for sale or are "exchanged in a market".[21] In the marketplace, where commodities are sold,
        "use value" is not helpful in facilitating the sale of commodities. Accordingly, in addition to having use
        value, commodities must have an "exchange value"—a value that could be expressed in the market.[22]

        Prior to Marx, many economists debated as to what elements made up exchange value. Adam Smith maintained that
        exchange value was made up of rent, profit, labour and the costs of wear and tear on the instruments of
        husbandry.[23] David Ricardo, a follower of Adam Smith, modified Smith's approach on this point by alleging that
        labour alone is the content of the exchange value of any good or service.[24] While maintaining that all
        exchange value in commodities was derived directly from the hands of the people that made the commodity, Ricardo
        noted that only part of the exchange value of the commodity was paid to the worker who made the commodity. The
        other part of the value of this particular commodity was labour that was not paid to the worker—unpaid labour.
        This unpaid labour was retained by the owner of the means of production. In capitalist society, the capitalist
        owns the means of production and therefore the unpaid labour is retained by the capitalist as rent or as profit.
        The means of production means the site where the commodity is made, the raw products that are used in the
        production and the instruments or machines that are used for the production of the commodity.

        However, not all commodities are reproducible nor were all commodities originally intended to be sold in the
        market. These priced goods are also treated as commodities, e.g. human labour-power, works of art and natural
        resources ("earth itself is an instrument of labour"),[25] even though they may not be produced specifically for
        the market, or be non-reproducible goods.

        Marx's analysis of the commodity is intended to help solve the problem of what establishes the economic value of
        goods, using the labour theory of value. This problem was extensively debated by Adam Smith, David Ricardo[26]
        and Karl Rodbertus-Jagetzow among others.

        All three of the above-mentioned economists rejected the theory that labour composed 100% of the exchange value
        of any commodity. In varying degrees, these economists turned to supply and demand to establish the price of
        commodities. Marx held that the "price" and the "value" of a commodity were not synonymous. Price of any
        commodity would vary according to the imbalance of supply to demand at any one period of time. The "value" of
        the same commodity would be consistent and would reflect the amount of labour value used to produce that
        commodity.

        Prior to Marx, economists noted that the problem with using the "quantity of labour" to establish the value of
        commodities was that the time spent by an unskilled worker would be longer than the time spent on the same
        commodity by a skilled worker. Thus, under this analysis, the commodity produced by an unskilled worker would be
        more valuable than the same commodity produced by the skilled worker. Marx pointed out, however, that in society
        at large, an average amount of time that was necessary to produce the commodity would arise. This average time
        necessary to produce the commodity Marx called the "socially necessary labour time".[27] Socially necessary
        labour time was the proper basis on which to base the "exchange value" of a given commodity.

        Commodity Super Cycle
        Commodity Super Cycles are periods of times, around a decade where commodities as a whole trade at a price that
        is greater than their long term Moving average.[28] A Super Cycle will usually occur when there is large
        industrial and commercial change in a country or world that requires more resources to support the change. As
        prices rise, goods and services that rely on commodities rise with them.

        History of Super Cycles
        There have been four super cycles over the last 120 years worldwide.[29] The first commodity super cycle started
        in late 1890 and was accelerated on the back of widespread U.S. industrialization and World War 1. In 1917
        commodity prices peaked and then entered a downtrend to the 1930s. As war erupted in Europe in the late 1930s
        and eventually including the U.S. the world saw a new cycle begin. Countries were not just preparing for war but
        also the Aftermath of World War II as lots of Europe and Asia faced heavy rebuilding. This cycle eventually
        peaked in 1951 and faded away in the early 70s.[30] In the 1970s as world economies grew they needed more
        materials and energy to support expansion leading to increases in prices across the board. This boom came to an
        end as foreign investments fled as extractive industries became nationalized.[30] The most recent of commodity
        super cycles began in 2000 as China joined the World Trade Organization.[30] China was also in the beginning of
        their boom as industry and expansion took off. Workers moved into cities as emerging industries took off and
        offered a lots of new jobs and opportunities. In 2008 when the Great Recession hit it put a halt onto the
        supercycle as GDP's across the world tanked leaving many economies in recessions.

        The next or the fifth supercycle could arrive as the world enters the final phases of the COVID-19 pandemic and
        starts to build massive clean energy infrastructure in view of the commodity price increase. </p>

    <p> What Are Commodities?
        Commodities are raw materials used to manufacture consumer products. They are inputs in the production of other
        goods and services, rather than finished goods sold to consumers.

        In commerce, commodities are basic resources that are interchangeable with other goods of the same type. The
        quality of a given commodity may differ slightly, but it is essentially uniform across producers. When traded on
        an exchange, commodities must also meet specified minimum standards, also known as a basis grade. KEY TAKEAWAYS
        A commodity is a basic good used in commerce that is interchangeable with other commodities of the same type.
        Commodities are most often used as inputs in the production of other goods or services.
        Investors and traders can buy and sell commodities directly in the spot (cash) market or via derivatives such as
        futures and options.
        Hard commodities refer to energy and metals products, while soft commodities are often agricultural goods.
        Many investors view allocating commodities in a portfolio as a hedge against inflation. Understanding
        Commodities
        Commodities are the raw inputs used in the production of goods. They may also be basic staples such as certain
        agricultural products. The important feature of a commodity is that there is very little differentiation in that
        good, regardless of who produces it. A barrel of oil is basically the same product, regardless of the producer.
        The same goes for a bushel of wheat or a ton of ore. By contrast, the quality and features of a given consumer
        product will often be quite different depending on the producer (e.g., Coke vs. Pepsi).1

        Some traditional examples of commodities include grains, gold, beef, oil, and natural gas. More recently, the
        definition has expanded to include financial products, such as foreign currencies and indexes.

        Commodities can be bought and sold on specialized exchanges as financial assets. There are also well-developed
        derivatives markets whereby you can buy contracts on such commodities (e.g., forwards, futures, and options).
        Some experts believe that investors should hold at least some portion of a well-diversified portfolio in
        commodities since they are not highly correlated with other financial assets and may serve as an inflation
        hedge. Buyers and Producers of Commodities
        The sale and purchase of commodities are usually carried out through futures contracts on exchanges that
        standardize the quantity and minimum quality of the commodity being traded. For example, the Chicago Board of
        Trade (CBOT) stipulates that one wheat contract is for 5,000 bushels and states what grades of wheat can be used
        to satisfy the contract.3
        CME Group. "Wheat Futures and Options."


        Two types of traders trade commodity futures. The first are buyers and producers of commodities that use
        commodity futures contracts for the hedging purposes for which they were originally intended. These traders make
        or take delivery of the actual commodity when the futures contract expires.

        For example, the wheat farmer who plants a crop can hedge against the risk of losing money if the price of wheat
        falls before the crop is harvested. The farmer can sell wheat futures contracts when the crop is planted and
        have a guaranteed, predetermined price for the wheat when it is harvested. Commodities Speculators
        The second type of commodities trader is the speculator. These are traders who trade in the commodities markets
        for the sole purpose of profiting from the volatile price movements. These traders never intend to make or take
        delivery of the actual commodity when the futures contract expires.

        Many futures markets are very liquid and have a high degree of daily range and volatility, making them very
        tempting markets for intraday traders. Many index futures are used by brokerages and portfolio managers to
        offset risk. Also, since commodities do not typically trade in tandem with equity and bond markets, some
        commodities can be used effectively to diversify an investment portfolio. Commodities Speculators
        The second type of commodities trader is the speculator. These are traders who trade in the commodities markets
        for the sole purpose of profiting from the volatile price movements. These traders never intend to make or take
        delivery of the actual commodity when the futures contract expires.

        Special Considerations
        Commodity prices typically rise when inflation accelerates, which is why investors often flock to them for their
        protection during times of increasing inflation—particularly when it is unexpected. So, commodity demand
        increases because investors flock to them, raising their prices. The prices of goods and services then go up to
        match the increase. This causes commodities to often serve as a hedge against a currency's decreased buying
        power when the inflation rate increases. What Is the Relationship Between Commodities and Derivatives?
        The modern commodities market relies heavily on derivative securities, such as futures and forward contracts.
        Buyers and sellers can transact with one another easily and in large volumes without needing to exchange the
        physical commodities themselves. Many buyers and sellers of commodity derivatives do so to speculate on the
        price movements of the underlying commodities for purposes such as risk hedging and inflation protection.

        What Determines Commodity Prices?
        Like all assets, commodity prices are ultimately determined by supply and demand. For example, a booming economy
        might lead to increased demand for oil and other energy commodities. Supply and demand for commodities can be
        impacted in many ways, such as economic shocks, natural disasters, and investor appetite (investors may purchase
        commodities as an inflation hedge if they expect inflation to rise).

        What Is the Difference Between a Commodity and a Security or Asset?
        Commodities are physical products that are meant to be consumed or used in the production process. Assets, on
        the other hand, are goods that are not consumed through their use. For instance, money or a piece of machinery
        are used for productive purposes, but persist as they are used. A security is a financial instrument that is not
        a physical product. It is a legal representation (e.g., a contract or claim) that represents certain cash flows
        generated from various activities (such as a stock representing the future cash flows of a business).

        What Are the Types of Commodities?
        Hard commodities are usually classified as those that are mined or extracted from the earth. These can include
        metals, ore, and petroleum (energy) products. Soft commodities instead refer to those that are grown, such as
        agricultural products. These include wheat, cotton, coffee, sugar, soybeans, and other harvested items.

        Where Are Commodities Traded?
        The major U.S. commodity exchanges are ICE Futures U.S. and the CME Group, which operate four major exchanges:
        the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT), the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), the New York Mercantile Exchange
        (NYMEX), and the Commodity Exchange, Inc. (COMEX). There are also major commodities exchanges located around the
        world.

        The Bottom Line
        Commodities are basic goods and materials that are widely used and are not meaningfully differentiated from one
        another. Examples of commodities include barrels of oils, bushels of wheat, or megawatt-hours of electricity.
        Commodities have long been an important part of commerce, but in recent decades, commodities trading has become
        increasingly standardized. </p>
    <br>
    <p> A commodity is any good or service that is interchangeable with another good or service of the same type.

        Commodities generally include basic resources, agricultural products and energy products because they are
        essentially uniform.

        For example, oil from Newfoundland can be interchanged with oil from the Middle East: it is a commodity because
        where it comes from makes no difference. Similarly, wheat from Western Canada can be interchanged with wheat
        from Ukraine.

        For this reason, commodities of the same type are priced more or less the same throughout the marketplace
        (instead of on a product-by-product basis). </p>
    <br>
    <p> What is a commodity? Looking for a commodity definition? A commodity is a basic good or primary good that one
        can group under standard headings before they are then traded. Commodities are mostly used as part of the
        production of finished goods and services and fall into categories such as oils, minerals and agricultural
        produce. Each commodity is interchangeable, which is why any attempts to set up a gemstone commodity market have
        failed since each gemstone is different from the other.

        Where have you heard about commodities?
        As commodities form part of a finished good or service, they can quickly impact everything else along the supply
        chain. For example, if there is a shortage of a commodity, production is affected and thus the end price of the
        product or service is too. For this reason, the media often reports on when supply of commodities has risen or
        fallen as it usually means everyday products rise or fall in price. For example, a bad crop or flooding may
        cause the price of potatoes to rise, or political developments causing oil to become more expensive would
        generally cause a hike in petrol prices. What you need to know about commodities…
        There are many different types of commodities, but the basic idea is that each type of the commodity is the same
        regardless of its producer. For example, a portion of grain from one producer will likely not differ from
        another portion of grain from another producer.

        Types of commodities

        Commodities can be soft or hard, with energy forming a subcategory under hard commodities. All types of
        commodities are found in the futures market and are regularly traded by investors looking to make a profit.

        Soft commodities: this generally refers to commodities that are grown – for example, coffee, corn, sugar, cocoa,
        wheat, livestock and agricultural goods are all classed as soft commodities. The production of these commodities
        relies a lot on the weather so any unseasonable weather or a strong storm season can have a huge affect on the
        production of these commodities. As a result, the prices of soft commodities are often unpredictable making soft
        commodities a volatile type of commodity. This is particularly true for crops as they can be only produced in
        specific regions around the world where temperature, soil quality and humidity are deemed ideal. If these
        conditions differ in any way, it can have a detrimental affect on crop production. Hard commodities: this
        generally means mined commodities, referring to assets including energy goods (such as oil and natural goods)
        and metals (such as copper, silver, gold, aluminium and steel). When commodities make the headlines, it’s
        usually centred on hard commodities as their production and supply often relate to economic health, whether that
        be on a local, regional or global basis. Countries where a large amount of hard commoditiesare produced (Peru,
        for example, which produces high quantities of gold) rely a lot on exports and as a result currency is often
        tied to its value.

        Energy commodities: these are a subcategory within hard commodities, referring to assets such as oil, coil and
        natural gas. Since the world has a strong appetite (and arguably a growing appetite) for energy, energy
        commodities are a popular choice of investment for traders looking to make large profits. The most commonly
        traded type of energy commodity is crude oil, with over 87 million barrels traded every single day. Other major
        types of energy commodities include natural gas, which is used for everything from heating houses to cooking
        meals, and coal, which makes up 20% of the world’s total energy consumption. Uranium, electricity, solar power,
        ethanol and wind power are other types of energy commodities.

        How you can invest in commodities: Those looking to invest in commodities should be aware that commodities are
        usually traded in large volumes electronically. As a result, it is not always a wise idea for beginner traders
        to invest in commodities directly. Instead, beginner traders looking to invest in commodities are sometimes
        recommended to invest indirectly via companies working in the production of commodities – a silver mining
        company, for example. This less-risky approach would be considered a better starting point as it does not
        present the problem/dilemmas of minimum buy quantities and physical storage of the commodity.

        Another indirect way to invest in commoditiesis via a fund or investment trust, which offers diversification
        within your portfolio, with funds investing in different types of commodities and thus spreading the risk.
        Commodity funds can be true commodity funds (where they have direct holdings in commodities); commodity funds
        that hold futures (similar to a mutual fund strategy); natural resource funds (which invest in companies that
        engage in business relating to commodities); and combination funds (which invest in both actual commodities and
        commodity futures).

        Trading commodities with CFDs (contracts for difference) is a popular way to speculate on the financial markets.
        CFD brokers quote prices on many global commodity markets including gold, copper, oil and wheat. If you choose
        to trade commodities using CFDs, you’ll have both the advantages and the disadvantages of trading on margin. But
        you’ll always get a cash settlement rather than a physical delivery – and that’s an important issue to consider.
        Those choosing toinvest in commodities physically will encounter the issue of storage. Although there are
        several firms that now offer safe asset storage, direct investors in commodities will incur the additional costs
        of storage and insurance, as well as the costs associated with buying and selling. In order for the investor to
        ensure they buy commodities at a good price, they will also have to invest in large quantities of the commodity.

        Summing up, when starting out in commodity investing, it is best to either invest in an investment fund or trust
        or buy shares in associated companies. It is also recommended that traders keep in mind that commodities are
        volatile and that they look at the rest of their portfolio as many oil and gas companies make up a large portion
        of the FTSE 100.

        Commodities buyers and producers

        The trading of commodities is usually carried out via futures contracts on exchanges, with a minimum commodity
        quantity of quality usually specified. Buyers and producers of commodities are one of the two types traders of
        commodity futures, usually trading for hedging purposes and making or taking delivery of the physical commodity
        once the contract expires. Commodities speculators

        The other main type of trader trading in commodity futures is the commodity speculator, who trades in
        commodities with the intention to make a profit from extreme market volatility. Being a speculator often
        involves a large quantity of research and the constant analysis of technical and fundamental factors affecting
        the market. Speculators do not intend to ever make or take delivery of the actual commodity when the contract
        expires, but instead takes a long or short financial position with the aim to make money. So long as they play
        by the rules and regulations within the market, commodity speculators bring liquidity to the market, helping the
        market to operate efficiently for everyone involved.

        Exchanges

        As mentioned above, commodities are traded on exchanges with each exchange specialising in a certain type of
        commodity – for example, the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) trades in corn, silver, wheat, oats, rice, soybeans,
        ethanol and gold and the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) trades in natural gas, electricity and crude oil. The
        largest physical commodity exchange is the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), which trades in a wide range of
        different products, with the Commodity Exchange Inc operating as a division within the NYMEX.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p> A commodity, also called primary product or primary good, is a good sold for production or consumption just as
        it was found in nature. Commodities include crude oil, coal, copper or iron ore, rough diamonds, and
        agricultural products such as wheat, coffee beans or cotton; they are often traded on commodity exchanges.

        The Standard international trade classification distinguishes five main categories (sections) of commodities or
        primary goods:

        Food and live animals (SITC 0 );
        Beverages and tobacco (SITC 1);
        Crude materials, excluding fuels (SITC 2);
        Mineral fuels (SITC 3);
        Animal and vegetable oils, fats and waxes (SITC 4).
        Sections 0 and 1 can be grouped together as 'Food and drink', 2 and 4 as 'Raw materials'. </p>
    <br>
    <p> Types of Commodities
        There are three major types of commodities; agriculture, energy, and metals. These three are differentiated in
        the means of accessing them. The means of accessing them is based on whether they are hard or soft. Hard
        commodities are obtained from mining using either the open pit or the underground shaft method. The energy and
        metal commodities can be obtained through these means and classified under the hard commodities. Energy
        commodities are characterized by renewability where some of them are naturally replenishing but are limited in
        their availability per unit time.

        Metal commodities portray the characteristic of conveyable value, which means that their ownership is
        transferrable from one owner to another. Conversely, agricultural commodities are obtained by tilling the land
        and planting crops for harvest and rearing or feeding livestock and are classified as soft commodities.
        Agricultural commodities are characterized by bulk because they are harvested in plenty. They are also
        characterized by nature, where if rains do not fall, there is a likelihood of minimal produce because of
        insufficient water. The common characteristics amongst these commodities are that they depict uniformity from
        all producers, they are all used in the production process as inputs, and they are natural resources. </p>
    <br>
    <p> What Is a Commodity?
        A commodity is a raw material that is typically used as input for producing other goods or services.

        Commodities are typically produced uniformly, meaning a specific amount of a commodity produced from one source
        is essentially interchangeable with the same amount produced from another source. Investors can buy and sell
        commodities directly or trade commodity derivatives on public exchanges.

        Commodity buyers generally include producers who plan to use the commodity for production and speculators who
        attempt to profit from the commodity's rising price. Investors often hold commodities in their portfolios as a
        means of diversification, and commodities are a popular way to hedge against the negative impact of inflation.

        Types of Commodities
        Commodities are broken down into two categories and four main classes. Hard commodities are commodities that
        require mining or drilling to produce. Soft commodities are either grown or ranched.

        Hard commodities include:

        Energy. This class includes commodities, such as crude oil, natural gas, coal, propane, unleaded gasoline,
        ethanol and even uranium.
        Metals. Popular metal commodities include precious metals, such as gold and silver, and industrial metals, such
        as copper and aluminum. Metals such as lithium and cobalt are also central to the future energy sector for their
        utility in electric vehicles and other clean energy technology.
        Soft commodities include:

        Agricultural products. Agricultural products include crops and other plant products, such as coffee, corn, wheat
        and lumber.
        Livestock and meat. Livestock includes animals and animal products farmed for consumption, such as cattle, beef,
        pork bellies and milk.
        How to Trade Commodities
        Commodities futures contracts are the most popular way of trading commodities. Futures contracts are legally
        binding agreements to buy or sell a specific asset at a specific price on a specific future date. Futures
        contract buyers are assuming the risk of future price changes in the underlying asset, while futures contract
        sellers are offsetting that risk. </p>

    <p> <strong> Commodity Market: Definition, Types, Example, and How It Works: </strong> What Is a Commodity Market?
        A commodity market is a marketplace for buying, selling, and trading raw materials or primary products.

        Commodities are often split into two broad categories: hard and soft commodities. Hard commodities include
        natural resources that must be mined or extracted, such as gold, rubber, and oil, whereas soft commodities are
        agricultural products or livestock, such as corn, wheat, coffee, sugar, soybeans. <br> <b> KEY TAKEAWAYS </b>
        A commodity market involves buying, selling, or trading a raw product, such as oil, gold, or coffee.
        There are hard commodities, which are generally natural resources, and soft commodities, which are livestock or
        agricultural goods.
        Spot commodities markets involve immediate delivery, while derivatives markets entail delivery in the future.
        Investors can gain exposure to commodities by investing in companies that have exposure to commodities or by
        investing in commodities directly via futures contracts.
        The major U.S. commodity exchanges are ICE Futures U.S. and the CME Group, which holds four major exchanges: the
        Chicago Board of Trade, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the New York Mercantile Exchange, and the Commodity
        Exchange, Inc. How Commodity Markets Work
        Commodities markets allow producers and consumers of commodity products to gain access to them in a centralized
        and liquid marketplace. These market actors can also use commodities derivatives to hedge future consumption or
        production. Speculators, investors, and arbitrageurs also play an active role in these markets.

        Certain commodities, such as precious metals, have been thought to be a good hedge against inflation, and a
        broad set of commodities as an alternative asset class can help diversify a portfolio. Because the prices of
        commodities tend to move in opposition to stocks, some investors also rely on commodities during periods of
        market volatility.

        In the past, commodities trading required significant amounts of time, money, and expertise, and was primarily
        limited to professional traders. Today, there are more options for participating in the commodity markets.

        History of Commodity Markets
        Trading commodities goes back to the dawn of human civilization as tribal clans and newly established kingdoms
        would barter and trade with one another for food, supplies, and other items. Commodity trading predates that of
        stocks and bonds by many centuries. The rise of empires such as ancient Greece and Rome can be directly linked
        to their ability to create complex trading systems and facilitate the exchange of commodities across vast swaths
        via routes like the famous Silk Road that linked Europe to the Far East.12

        Today, commodities are still exchanged throughout the world—and on a massive scale. Trading has also become more
        sophisticated with the advent of exchanges and derivatives markets. Exchanges regulate and standardize commodity
        trading, allowing for liquid and efficient markets.
        The majority of exchanges carry at least a few different commodities, although some specialize in a single
        group. Perhaps the most influential modern commodities market is the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT), established
        in 1848. The CBOT originally traded only agricultural commodities such as wheat, corn, and soybeans in order to
        help farmers and commodity consumers manage risks by removing price uncertainty from those agricultural
        products.3

        Today, it lists options and futures contracts on a wide range of products including gold, silver, U.S. Treasury
        bonds, and energy products. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group merged with the Chicago Board of Trade
        (CBOT) in 2007, adding interest rates and equity index products to the group's existing product agricultural
        offerings.4

        Some commodities exchanges have merged or gone out of business. In the U.S., the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
        (CME) acquired three other commodity exchanges in the mid-2000s.

        First, CME acquired the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) in 2007, and then in 2008 acquired the New York Mercantile
        Exchange (NYMEX) and the Commodity Exchange, Inc. (COMEX).56 All four exchanges make up the CME Group. Also in
        2007, the New York Board of Trade merged with Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), forming ICE Futures U.S.78 Each
        exchange offers a wide range of global benchmarks across major asset classes.

        Types of Commodity Markets
        Generally speaking, commodities trade either in spot markets or derivatives markets. Spot markets are also
        referred to as “physical markets” or “cash markets” where buyers and sellers exchange physical commodities for
        immediate delivery.

        Derivatives markets involve forwards, futures, and options. Forwards and futures are derivatives contracts that
        use the spot market as the underlying asset. These are contracts that give the owner control of the underlying
        asset at some point in the future, for a price agreed upon today. Only when the contracts expire would physical
        delivery of the commodity or other asset take place, and often traders will roll over or close out their
        contracts in order to avoid making or taking delivery altogether. Commodity trading conducted outside the
        operation of the exchanges is referred to as the over-the-counter (OTC) market. Forwards and futures are
        generally the same, except that forwards are customizable and trade over-the-counter, whereas futures are
        standardized and traded on exchanges.

        Examples of Commodities Markets
        The major exchanges in the U.S., which trade commodities, are domiciled in Chicago and New York with several
        exchanges in other locations within the country. Commodities traded on the CBOT, for example, include corn,
        gold, silver, soybeans, wheat, oats, rice, and ethanol.9 The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) trades
        commodities such as milk, butter, feeder cattle, cattle, pork bellies, lumber, and lean hogs.10

        The New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) trades commodities on its exchange such as oil, gold, silver, copper,
        aluminum, palladium, platinum, heating oil, propane, and electricity.11
        CME Group. "NYMEX/COMEX Exchange Volume Report - Monthly," Pages 1, 3, 18.

        Formerly known as the New York Board of Trade (NYBOT), ICE Futures U.S. commodities include coffee, cocoa,
        orange juice, sugar, and ethanol on its exchange.1213

        The London Metal Exchange and Tokyo Commodity Exchange are prominent international commodity exchanges.
        Commodities are predominantly traded electronically; however, several U.S. exchanges still use the open outcry
        method.
        Commodity Market Requirements
        In the U.S., the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) regulates commodity futures and options markets.
        The CFTC's objective is to promote competitive, efficient, and transparent markets that help protect consumers
        from fraud and unscrupulous practices. The CFTC and related regulations were designed to prevent and remove
        obstructions on interstate commerce in commodities by regulating transactions on commodity exchanges. For
        example, regulations look to limit, or abolish, short selling and eliminate the possibility of market and price
        manipulation, such as cornering markets.

        The law that established the CFTC has been updated several times since it was created, most notably in the wake
        of the 2007-2008 financial crisis. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act gave the CFTC
        authority over the swaps market, which was previously unregulated. Commodity Market Requirements

        spotlight after ten leading investment banks were caught up in an international precious metals manipulation
        probe by the CFTC and U.S. Department of Justice in 2015.
        Commodity Market Trading vs. Stock Trading
        For most individual investors, accessing commodities markets, whether spot or derivatives, is untenable. Direct
        access to these markets typically requires a special brokerage account and/or certain permissions. Because
        commodities are considered an alternative asset class, pooled funds that traded commodities futures, such as
        CTAs, typically only allow accredited investors. Still, ordinary investors can gain indirect access to
        commodities via the stock market itself. Stocks on mining or materials companies tend to be correlated with
        commodities prices, and there are various ETFs now that track various commodities or commodities indexes.

        Investors looking to diversify their portfolio can look to these ETFs, but for most long-term investors stocks
        and bonds will make up the core of their holdings. Moreover, because commodity prices tend by more volatile than
        stocks and bonds, commodities trading is often most suited for those with higher risk tolerance and/or longer
        time horizon. How Do I Find Out How the Commodity Markets Are Doing Today?
        Many online financial portals will provide some indication of certain commodities prices such as gold and crude
        oil. You can also find prices on the websites of commodity exchanges.

        What Do Commodities Traders Do?
        Commodities traders buy and sell either physical (spot) commodities or derivatives contracts that use a physical
        commodity as its underlying. Depending on what type of trader you are, you will use this market for different
        purposes, for instance, buying or selling a physical product, hedging, speculating, or arbitraging. Are
        Commodities a Good Investment?
        Like any investment, commodities can be a good investment but also come with risks. To invest in commodities, an
        investor needs to understand the markets of the commodity they wish to trade in. For example, oil prices can
        fluctuate based on the political climate in the Middle East, so a trader should be well-versed in current events
        in that area.

        The type of investment also matters. ETFs provide more diversification and lower risks, whereas futures are more
        speculative and the risks are higher because of margin requirements.

        That being said, commodities can be a hedge against inflation, and gold, in particular, can be a hedge against a
        market downturn. How Do Commodities Markets Work?
        For spot markets, buyers and sellers exchange cash for immediate delivery of the physical product. In
        derivatives markets, buyers and sellers exchange cash for the right to future delivery of that product.

        Oftentimes, derivatives holders will roll over or close out their positions before delivery can happen. Forwards
        trade over-the-counter and are customized between counterparties. Futures and options are listed on exchanges
        and have standardized contracts that are more highly regulated. How Do Commodities Markets Work?

        What Are Some Examples of Commodities?
        There are several commodities available. Energy products include crude oil, natural gas, and gasoline. Precious
        metals include gold, silver, and platinum. Agricultural products include wheat, corn, soybeans, and livestock.
        Other commodities you can trade are coffee, sugar, cotton, and frozen orange juice.

        The Bottom Line
        Trading commodities can be a way to diversify holdings, hedge against inflation, and realize a profit, but
        traders should have a high tolerance for risk if they choose this path. As with other high-risk, high-reward
        trading opportunities, be sure you know and understand the strategies behind trading commodities and their
        derivatives before you add this asset type to your portfolio.

        A callus, sometimes spelled callous, is a very hard, thick layer of skin that's usually found on the bottoms of
        your feet. When you act in a callous way, or exhibit your callousness, you could say you're "emotionally
        hardened." As early as 1670, this figurative meaning of callous was added to the literal definition. And
        callousness is a great word for the trait of being hardened against feeling empathy. </p>

        calloused. We often use callous, as an adjective or a verb, in the metaphorical sense for emotionally hardened.
        If someone is unmoved by other people's problems, you might say he shows a callous indifference to human
        suffering or that his heart has been calloused by his own problems. </p>

        Confiscate derives from the Latin confiscat, meaning "to store in a chest, or give to the treasury." In school,
        if the boys begin throwing pencils at each other, the teacher will confiscate them and "store” them in her desk.

    <p>According to the Oxford English Dictionary, “diversity” is defined as “the practice or quality of including or
        involving people from a range of different social and ethnic backgrounds and of different genders, sexual
        orientations, etc.” [1]. Because technology has helped to make the world more accessible, and with travel and
        immigration (particularly when there is no pandemic), people are no longer working or living in an insular
        environment. Living and working with people who have differences is common. By embracing these differences, we
        celebrate the diversity of the human experience and enrich our profession.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Diversity refers to the variety of differences among people, encompassing race, gender, age, experiences,
        talents, skills, and opinions. In the workplace, it means having employees with varied backgrounds and
        perspectives, ensuring a broader range of ideas and fostering creativity and innovation. To better understand
        and define diversity, we can think about it in a social context. For example, at work, you might interact with
        coworkers of different genders, age groups, faiths and so on. Likewise, at school, students may come from
        different socio-economic classes and have different personalities and physical abilities.

        While the first things that come to mind when we talk about diversity are race and gender, there’s more than
        that. For a deeper analysis, you can refer to the breakdown of the different types of diversity. What is
        diversity in the workplace?
        To come up with a workplace diversity definition, we have to think about all the different characteristics that
        employees (could) have. First, we have the protected characteristics, such as race, age, gender and sexual
        orientation. And secondly, we have all the different:

        Experiences
        Talents
        Skills
        Opinions
        Personalities
        These differences, for example employees’ talents, are less obvious and require the organization’s effort and
        proactiveness to shine.</p>

    <p>Diversity = being mindful of all dimensions of human differences and defining diversity
        in the broadest sense to mean the inclusion of all persons regardless of racial and ethnic
        background, nationality, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, veteran status,
        religious, secular, and spiritual beliefs, ability, age, and socioeconomic status. Diversity
        embodies inclusiveness, mutual respect, multiple perspectives, and serves as a catalyst for
        change resulting in equity.</p>
    <br>
    <p>For the Greater Good Science Center, “diversity” refers to both an obvious fact of human life—namely, that there
        are many different kinds of people—and the idea that this diversity drives cultural, economic, and social
        vitality and innovation. Indeed, decades of research suggest that intolerance hurts our well-being—and that
        individuals thrive when they are able to tolerate and embrace the diversity of the world.

        In North America, the word “diversity” is strongly associated with racial diversity. However, that is just one
        dimension of the human reality. We also differ in gender, language, manners and culture, social roles, sexual
        orientation, education, skills, income, and countless other domains. In recent years, some advocates have even
        argued for recognition of “neurodiversity,” which refers to the range of differences in brain function.</p>

        immigration status, and language. There is a recognition that people have multiple identities and that social

        with unlimited power, often one who is unfair and cruel): </p>
    <br>
    <p> In political science, despotism (Greek: Δεσποτισμός, romanized: despotismós) is a form of government in which a
        single entity rules with absolute power. Normally, that entity is an individual, the despot (as in an
        autocracy), but societies which limit respect and power to specific groups have also been called despotic.[1]

        Colloquially, the word despot applies pejoratively to those who use their power and authority to oppress their
        populace or subordinates. More specifically, the term often applies to a head of state or government. In this
        sense, it is similar to the pejorative connotations that are associated with the terms tyrant and dictator.[2]
        The root despot comes from the Greek word despotes, which means "one with power." In ancient Greek usage, a
        despótès was technically a master who ruled in a household over those who were slaves or servants by nature.[3]
        The term has been used to describe many rulers and governments throughout history. It connoted the absolute
        authority and power exercised by the pharaohs of Ancient Egypt, signified nobility in Byzantine courts,
        designated the rulers of Byzantine vassal states, and acted as a title for Byzantine emperors. In this and other
        Greek or Greek influenced contexts, the term was used as an honorific rather than as a pejorative.

        Due to its reflexive connotation throughout history, the word despot cannot be objectively defined. While despot
        is closely related to other Greek words like basileus and autokrator, these connotations have also been used to
        describe a variety of rulers and governments throughout history, such as local chieftains, simple rulers, kings,
        and emperors. Of all the ancient Greeks, Aristotle was perhaps the most influential promoter of the concept of
        oriental despotism. He passed this ideology to his student, Alexander the Great, who conquered the Achaemenid
        Empire, which at the time was ruled by the despotic Darius III, the last king of the Achaemenid dynasty.
        Aristotle asserted that oriental despotism was not based on force, but on consent. Hence, fear could not be said
        to be its motivating force, but rather the servile nature of those enslaved, which would feed upon the power of
        the despot master.

        Within ancient Greek society, every Greek man was free and capable of holding office; both able to rule and be
        ruled. In contrast, among the barbarians, all were slaves by nature. Another difference Aristotle espoused was
        based on climates. He observed that the peoples of cold countries, especially those of Europe, were full of
        spirit but deficient in skill and intelligence, and that the peoples of Asia, although endowed with skill and
        intelligence, were deficient in spirit and hence were subjected to slavery. Possessing both spirit and
        intelligence, the Greeks were free to govern all other peoples.[4]

        For the historian Herodotus, it was the way of the Orient to be ruled by autocrats and, even though Oriental,
        the character faults of despots were no more pronounced than the ordinary man's, though given to much greater
        opportunity for indulgence. The story of Croesus of Lydia exemplifies this. Leading up to Alexander's expansion
        into Asia, most Greeks were repelled by the Oriental notion of a sun-king, and the divine law that Oriental
        societies accepted. Herodotus's version of history advocated a society where men became free when they consented
        lawfully to the social contract of their respective city-state. The concept of despotism, and especially
        oriental despotism, entered European political thought with Montesquieu's The Spirit of the Laws in the 18th
        century. The idea was not new or unique to Montesquieu's work, but Montesquieu's work is widely regarded as
        having been the most influential on modern political thought.
        <b> History:</b> In its classical form, despotism is a state in which a single individual (the despot) holds all
        the power and authority embodying the state, and everyone else is a subsidiary person. This form of despotism
        was common in the first forms of statehood and civilization; the Pharaoh of Egypt is an exemplary figure of the
        classical despot.

        Edward Gibbon suggested that the increasing use of Oriental-style despotism by the Roman emperors was a major
        factor in the fall of the Roman Empire, particularly from the reign of Elagabalus:

        As the attention of the new emperor was diverted by the most trifling amusements, he wasted many months in his
        luxurious progress from Syria to Italy, passed at Nicomedia his first winter after his victory, and deferred
        till the ensuing summer his triumphal entry into the capital. A faithful picture, however, which preceded his
        arrival, and was placed by his immediate order over the altar of Victory in the senate-house, conveyed to the
        Romans the just but unworthy resemblance of his person and manners. He was drawn in his sacerdotal robes of silk
        and gold, after the loose flowing fashion of the Medes and Phoenicians; his head was covered with a lofty tiara,
        his numerous collars and bracelets were adorned with gems of an inestimable value. His eyebrows were tinged with
        black, and his cheeks painted with an artificial red and white. The grave senators confessed with a sigh, that,
        after having long experienced the stern tyranny of their own countrymen, Rome was at length humbled beneath the
        effeminate luxury of Oriental despotism. (The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Book One, Chapter Six)

        Yet although the word has a pejorative meaning nowadays, it was once a legitimate title of office in the
        Byzantine Empire, first used under Manuel I Komnenos (1143–1180) who created it for his appointed heir
        Alexius-Béla, according to Gyula Moravcsik as a translation of Béla's Hungarian title úr. It was typically
        bestowed on sons-in-law and later sons of the Emperor and, beginning in the 13th century, it was bestowed to
        foreign princes. The Despot wore elaborate costumes similar to the Emperor's and had many privileges. Despots
        ruled over parts of the empire called Despotates. In the Orthodox Liturgy, if celebrated in Greek, the bishop is
        addressed by the deacon as Despota even today.

        The modern term seems to have been coined by the opponents of Louis XIV of France in the 1690s, who applied the
        term despotisme to describe their monarch's somewhat free exercise of power, but the Enlightenment philosopher
        Montesquieu believed that while republics were suitable for small states and monarchies were ideal for
        moderate-sized states, despotism was an appropriate government for large states.[6] In enlightened absolutism
        (also known as benevolent despotism), which came to prominence in 18th century Europe, absolute monarchs used
        their authority to institute a number of reforms in the political systems and societies of their countries.

        At the same time, the term was used to imply tyrannical rule. The United States Declaration of Independence
        accused King George III of "a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object,
        evinc[ing] a design to reduce [the people] under absolute Despotism".[7] Nowadays, "despotism" can refer to any
        absolutist or dictatorial regime or leader that uses their power in a cruel manner.[8]

        <b> Contrast with absolute monarchy </b>
        According to Montesquieu, the difference between absolute monarchy and despotism is that in the case of the
        monarchy, a single person governs with absolute power by fixed and established laws, whereas a despot governs by
        his or her own will and caprice.[9]

        background or descent1. It is a social group that shares a common and distinctive culture, religion,
        language, or the like2. Ethnicity is an important aspect of identity and can be based on perceived shared
        attributes that distinguish one group from another3. For example, ethnicity can be used to describe the
        interrelationship between gender, ethnicity, and class1. The diverse experience of women of different
        ethnicities is another example1. a large group of people with a shared culture, language, history, set
        of traditions, etc., or the fact of belonging to one of these groups: Ethnicity definition, an ethnic group; a
        social group that shares a common and distinctive culture, religion, language, or the like:
        Representatives of several ethnicities were present. a large group of people who have the
        same national, racial, or cultural origins, or the state of belonging to such a group: Ethnicity comes from
        ethnic, which means “of a racial or tribal group.” So ethnicity is racial or tribal. feeling and desire to stay
        within the race or tribe to which one belongs. It also gives paramount importance to language. Firstly,
        extreme. ethnic groups limit their attachment or devotion to themselves. They begin thinking, without
        any real basis, that they are superior to all other groups or communities. The greatest ethnic group in
        terms of money and landed estates is the feudal (jagirdari”) class. Vast and spread all over the country, it
        has been regularized or institutionalized nationally. It has been ruling the country through Parliament
        and has been crushing the total population except for the industrial lords, rich merchants, powerful civil
        servants, and military commanders.
        Lastly, a general and basic kind of religious education should be provided through the mass media (the
        radio, TV, the press and the Internet) and in schools and colleges. This can negative the effects of
        ethnicity in some ways instead of accentuating (making more forceful) them in any way. For it is a fact
        that those who do not or cannot attach themselves to religion or a very healthy national outlook can
        easily embrace some ethnic group or ethnic interests.

        or stopped communicating and interacting with each other. Usually a gradual process rather than a
        single event, estrangement often involves periods of distance mixed with times of reconciliation.
        Estrangement can impact mental health and well-being, but therapy can help you cope and, if desired,
        reconnect with family members. Estrangement means experiencing distance or separation from others,
        such as family members, with notable diminished or complete loss of contact with previously close
        relationships. Estrangement is typically a process rather than a single event.3 A person who desires to
        separate themselves from another begins distancing themselves physically and emotionally from
        support and interdependence, usually because of prolonged patterns of problematic interactions. A
        schism between family members is complex and often cyclical, with periods of separation and
        reconciliation.2,4 This separation can be difficult, causing added confusion, stress, anxiety,
        and disenfranchised grief.3,4 A lack of finality and closure can substantially affect someone’s mental
        health and well-being.5 Estrangement can vary in length, with separations ranging from six months to

    <p> Use the adjective exorbitant when you want to describe something that is really just too much! You'll often hear
        people griping about exorbitant bank fees or exorbitant interest rates.

        The adjective exorbitant was originally a legal term to describe a case that was outside the bounds of the law.
        It comes from the Latin roots — the prefix ex, meaning "out of," and orbita, meaning "wheel track." You can see
        how the word now has come to be described as something that has gone way off the beaten track, especially in
        terms of price and value. </p>

        to “law”. The distinction between equity and law originates from England where courts were divided into two
        kinds, courts of equity and courts of law. For example a court of equity (as opposed to a court of law) can give
        equitable relief. Equitable relief represents a remedy apart from money damages, for example, ordering the
        losing party to fulfil their contractual duties (see also, specific performance). This represents an outcome
        based on fairness and justness rather than legal technicalities. In the United States, almost all courts have

    <p> When you do something equitably, you do it fairly or in an equal, impartial way. To share a pizza equitably, you
        need to give each of your friends the same number of slices.

        In an ideal society, people would be equitably paid for the work they do: men and women would make the same wage
        for doing the same job, for example. Most fair-minded people try to treat everyone equitably, although most of
        us tend to give special preference to those we love and care about. Equitably comes from the French équitable,
        "equitable or fair," ultimately from the Latin aequitatem, "equality, fairness." </p>

        bull to a cat show or drive a convertible in a snow storm. A feebleminded person has a feeble, or weak, mind.

        To be feebleminded is to be mentally slow. People with an IQ below a certain number are feebleminded in a
        technical sense. But this word is used more often for people who act dumb without the benefit of a medical
        excuse. Riding a bike without a helmet is feebleminded. Challenging a cheetah to a running race is feebleminded.
        To be feebleminded is to act like an idiot. </p>
    <br>
    <p> The term feeble-minded was used from the late 19th century in Europe, the United States and Australasia for
        disorders later referred to as illnesses or deficiencies of the mind.

        At the time, mental deficiency encompassed all degrees of educational and social deficiency. Within the concept
        of mental deficiency, researchers established a hierarchy, ranging from idiocy, at the most severe end of the
        scale; to imbecility, at the median point; and to feeble-mindedness at the highest end of functioning. The last
        was conceived of as a form of high-grade mental deficiency.[1]

        The development of the ranking system of mental deficiency has been attributed to Sir Charles Trevelyan in 1876,
        and was associated with the rise of eugenics.[2] The term and hierarchy had been used in that sense at least 10
        years previously. The earliest recorded use of the term in the English language dates from 1534, when it appears
        in one of the first English translations of the New Testament, the Tyndale Bible. A biblical commandment to
        "Comforte the feble mynded" is included in 1 Thessalonians. A London Times editorial of November 1834 describes
        the long-serving former Prime Minister Lord Liverpool as a "feeble-minded pedant of office". The British
        government's Royal Commission on the Care and Control of the Feeble-Minded (1904–1908), in its Report in 1908
        defined the feeble-minded as:

        [P]ersons who may be capable of earning a living under favourable circumstances, but are incapable from mental
        defect, existing from birth or from an early age: (1) of competing on equal terms with their normal fellows, or
        (2) of managing themselves and their affairs with ordinary prudence.[3]

        Despite being pejorative, in its day the term was considered, along with idiot, imbecile, and moron, to be a
        relatively precise psychiatric classification.

        The American psychologist Henry H. Goddard, who coined the term moron, was the director of the Vineland Training
        School (originally the Vineland Training School for Backward and Feeble-minded Children) at Vineland, New
        Jersey. Goddard was known for strongly postulating that "feeble-mindedness" was a hereditary trait, most likely
        caused by a single recessive gene. Goddard rang the eugenic "alarm bells" in his 1912 work, The Kallikak Family:
        A Study in the Heredity of Feeble-Mindedness, about those in the population who carried the recessive trait
        despite outward appearances of normality.

        In the first half of the 20th century, a diagnosis of "feeble-mindedness, in any of its grades" was a common
        criterion for many states in the United States, which embraced eugenics as a progressive measure, to mandate the
        compulsory sterilization of such patients. In the 1927 US Supreme Court case Buck v. Bell, Justice Oliver
        Wendell Holmes closed the 8–1 majority opinion upholding the sterilization of Carrie Buck, with the phrase,
        "Three generations of imbeciles are enough."[6] Buck, her mother and daughter were all classified as
        feeble-minded. </p>

    <p> Falter means to hesitate, stumble, or waver, and everything from faith to voices can do it. So if you want to
        keep your bride or groom happy, it's best not to falter when it's your turn to say "I do."

        Experts may falter if you ask them where falter came from, because the origins are pretty unclear. But everyone
        agrees on the current meaning: someone who falters is unsteady, wobbly, or unsure. You might falter while
        reciting a poem if you forget some of the lines, or falter crossing a rickety rope bridge when fear gets the
        most of you. But you certainly won't falter when someone asks you the meaning of this word. </p>

    <p>Godhead: Godhead (or godhood) refers to the essence or substance (ousia) of God in Christianity.
        Godhead (from Middle English godhede, "godhood", and unrelated to the modern word "head"), may
        refer to:Deity
        Divinity
        Conceptions of God
        In Abrahamic religions
        Godhead in Judaism, the unknowable aspect of God, which lies beyond actions or emanations
        Godhead in Christianity, the substantial essence or nature of the Christian God
        Godhead in Islam
        Divine nature or essence. The term Godhead is found three times in the King James Version: Acts
        17:29; Romans 1:20; and Colossians 2:9. In each of the three verses, a slightly different Greek word is
        used, but the definition of each is the same: “deity” or “divine nature.” The word Godhead is used to refer to
        God’s essential nature. We’ll take a look at each of these passages and what they mean. In
        summary, the Godhead is the essence of the Divine Being; the Godhead is the one and only Deity. The

    <br>
    <p> Polytheists tend to divide godhead into two categories. One of these belongs to the
        supernatural stratum. The being invested with godhead at this stratum rules over the entire
        system of causation and is the one to whom man turns for the fulfilment of his needs and for
        solutions to his problems. With this godhead the polytheists associate spirits, angels, jinn,
        heavenly bodies and several other beings. To them they address their prayers. They regard
        them as the objects of their worship. It is at their altars that offerings and sacrifices are
        placed. The second category of godhead belongs to the social and political stratum, and
        refers to the being who has the privilege of absolute sovereignty: the one who is entitled to
        make the rules of conduct for human life, the one who is entitled to unreserved obedience,
        the one who has unlimited authority to command in worldy matters. Polytheists of all ages
        have either wrested this godhead from God altogether, or they have had this godhead
        distributed, in addition to God, among many others such as royal dynastics, religious
        divines and the venerated personalities of society, whether they belonged to the past or to
        their own times. Many royal families have laid claim to godhead of the second category and,
        in order to consolidate their claim, they have pretended to be the offspring of gods in the
        former sense. In general there has been collusion between the religious and the ruling
        classes on this question. </p>

        the difference between the value of a company's assets and what profit it is expected to make in the future,
        which is included in the price paid when it is bought or sold: What is Goodwill?
        Goodwill is an intangible asset associated with the purchase of one company by another. Specifically, goodwill
        is recorded in a situation in which the purchase price is higher than the sum of the fair value of all visible
        solid assets and intangible assets purchased in the acquisition and the liabilities assumed in the process. The
        value of a company’s brand name, solid customer base, good customer relations, good employee relations, and any
        patents or proprietary technology represent some examples of goodwill. Goodwill Meaning in Accounting
        Goodwill arises when a company acquires another entire business. The amount of goodwill is the cost to purchase
        the business minus the fair market value of the tangible assets, the intangible assets that can be identified,
        and the liabilities obtained in the purchase. How to Calculate Goodwill
        To calculate goodwill, we should take the purchase price of a company and subtract the fair market value of
        identifiable assets and liabilities.

        Goodwill Formula:

        Goodwill = P−(A+L)

        where,

        P = Purchase price of the target company

        A = Fair market value of assets

        L = Fair market value of liabilities

        Types of Goodwill
        There are two distinct types:

        Purchased: Purchased goodwill is the difference between the value paid for an enterprise as a going concern and
        the sum of its assets less the sum of its liabilities, each item of which has been separately identified and
        valued.
        Inherent: It is the value of the business in excess of the fair value of its separable net assets. It is
        referred to as internally generated goodwill, and it arises over a period of time due to the good reputation of
        a business. It can also be called as self generated or non-purchased goodwill.
        For example, suppose you are selling an outstanding product or providing excellent service consistently. In that
        case, there is a high chance of an increase in goodwill.

        Goodwill Accounting Treatment
        There are five types of accounting treatment of goodwill at the time of admission of a new partner:

        When the amount of goodwill is brought in cash and not recorded in books.
        When the new partner brings his share of goodwill in cash and is retained in business.
        When the new partner does not bring his share of goodwill in cash.
        When goodwill already exists in the books.
        When goodwill is raised at its full value.
        Goodwill Example
        To put it in a simple term, a Company named ABC’s assets minus liabilities is ₹10 crores, and another company
        purchases the company ABC for ₹15 crores, the premium value following the acquisition is ₹5 crores. This ₹5
        crores will be included on the acquirer’s balance sheet as goodwill. It is also recorded when the purchase price
        of the target company is higher than the debt that is assumed.

        Factors Affecting Goodwill
        The following factors have an impact on the goodwill, which are:

        Location of the business : A business which is located in a suitable location will have a more favourable chance
        of higher goodwill than a business located in a remote location.
        Quality of goods and services: A business which is providing a higher quality of goods and services stands a
        great chance of earning more goodwill than competitors who provide inferior goods and services.
        Efficiency of management : An efficient management results in increase in profit of the business which enhances
        the goodwill of the business.
        Business Risk : A business having lesser risk has a better chance of creating goodwill than a high risk
        business.
        Nature of business: It means the type of products that business deals with, the level of competition in the
        market, demand for the products and the regulations impacting the business. A business having a favourable
        outcome in all these areas will have a greater goodwill.
        Favourable Contracts: A firm will enjoy a higher goodwill if it has access to favourable contracts for sale of
        products.
        Possession of trade mark and patents : Firms that have patents and trademarks will enjoy monopoly in the market,
        which will contribute to the increase in the goodwill of the firm.
        Capital : A firm with a higher return on investment along with lesser capital investment will be considered by
        buyers as more profitable and having more goodwill.

    <p>Homicides: Homicide, the killing of one human being by another. Homicide is a general term and may
        refer to a noncriminal act as well as the criminal act of murder. Some homicides are considered
        justifiable, such as the killing of a person to prevent the commission of a serious felony or to aid a
        representative of the law. Other homicides are said to be excusable, as when a person kills in selfdefense.
        A criminal homicide is one that is not regarded by the applicable criminal code as justifiable or
        excusable. All legal systems make important distinctions between different types of homicide, and
        punishments vary greatly according to the intent of the killer, the dangerousness of the killer’s conduct,
        and the circumstances of the act. (an act of) murder: the crime of killing a person; murder: the killing of
        one person by another. the police department that deals with unlawful killings. a murderer. Qatal.
        Homicide is an act in which a person kills another person.[1] A homicide requires only a volitional act or
        an omission that causes the death of another, and thus a homicide may result from accidental, reckless,
        or negligent acts even if there is no intent to cause harm.[2] Homicides can be divided into many
        overlapping legal categories, such as murder, manslaughter, justifiable homicide, assassination, killing
        in war (either following the laws of war or as a war crime), euthanasia, and capital punishment,
        depending on the circumstances of the death. These different types of homicides are often treated very
        differently in human societies; some are considered crimes, while others are permitted or
        even ordered by the legal system. Qatal-e-aam, nasal kashi.</p>

        endure. If you lose your job, you could end up experiencing financial hardship. Sometimes a hardship is

        In the teaching of the Catholic Church, an indulgence (Latin: indulgentia, from indulgeo, 'permit') is "a
        way to reduce the amount of punishment one has to undergo for sins".[1] The Catechism of the Catholic
        Church describes an indulgence as "a remission before God of the temporal punishment due
        to sins whose guilt has already been forgiven, which the faithful Christian who is duly disposed gains
        under certain prescribed conditions through the action of the Church which, as the minister
        of redemption, dispenses and applies with authority the treasury of the satisfactions of Christ and all of
        the saints".[2]

        [uncountable] formal willingness to ignore someone’s faults or weaknesses

        The word indulgence (Latin indulgentia, from indulgeo, to be kind or tender) originally meant kindness
        or favor; in post-classic Latin it came to mean the remission of a tax or debt. In Roman law and in
        the Vulgate of the Old Testament (Isaiah 61:1) it was used to express release from captivity or
        punishment. In theological language also the word is sometimes employed in its primary sense to signify
        the kindness and mercy of God. But in the special sense in which it is here considered, an indulgence is a
        remission of the temporal punishment due to sin, the guilt of which has been forgiven. Among the
        equivalent terms used in antiquity were pax, remissio, donatio, condonatio.
        The Decree of Indulgence for Divine Mercy Sunday grants a plenary or full indulgence to those who
        satisfy certain conditions established by the Church and a partial (incomplete) indulgence to those who
        fulfill some but not all or the conditions.

        on the circumstances, particularly where the defendant must stop its course of action to prevent
        possible injustice and irreparable harm to the plaintiff. an official order given by a law court, usually
        to stop someone from doing something: an official order given by a court, usually to stop someone from
        doing something:
        an official order to do or not do something, which is given by a court of law: Law. a judicial process or
        order requiring the person or persons to whom it is directed to do a particular act or to refrain from
        doing a particular act.
        an act or instance of enjoining. a command; order; admonition: the injunctions of the Lord.
        In law, an injunction is an order by a court to one or more of the parties in a civil trial to refrain from
        doing, or less commonly to do, some specified act or acts (the former kind of injunction is called
        prohibitory or preventive, the latter mandatory). The usual purpose of an injunction is to preserve the
        status quo in situations in which further acts of the specified type, or the failure to perform such acts,
        would cause one of the parties irreparable harm (i.e., harm that cannot be adequately remedied by an
        award of monetary damages). An injunction is a court order requiring a person or entity to either cease
        doing or else start doing some specific action. An injunction is a legal ruling by a judge that mandates an
        individual or other entity to either stop or start some action. Cease and desist orders are a common type
        of injunction that demands an individual or entity to stop some activity. An injunction is a court order,
        usually one telling someone not to do something.
        An injunction to do something is an order or strong request to do it.
        An injunction is an equitable remedy[a] in the form of a special court order that compels a party to do or
        refrain from specific acts. "When a court employs the extraordinary remedy of injunction, it directs the
        conduct of a party, and does so with the backing of its full coercive powers." A party that fails to comply
        with an injunction faces criminal or civil penalties, including possible monetary sanctions and
        even imprisonment. They can also be charged with contempt of court.
        The injunction is an equitable remedy, that is, a remedy that originated in the English courts of equity.
        Like other equitable remedies, it has traditionally been given when a wrong cannot be effectively remedied by an
        award of money damages. (The doctrine that reflects this is the requirement that an
        injunction can be given only when there is "no adequate remedy at law.") Injunctions are intended to
        make whole again someone whose rights have been violated. Nevertheless, when deciding whether to
        grant an injunction, courts also take into account the interests of non-parties (that is, the public
        interest). When deciding whether to give an injunction, and deciding what its scope should be, courts
        give special attention to questions of fairness and good faith. One manifestation of this is that
        injunctions are subject to equitable defenses, such as laches and unclean hands.
        Injunctions are given in many different kinds of cases. They can prohibit future violations of the law,
        such as trespass to real property, infringement of a patent, or the violation of a constitutional right (e.g.,
        the free exercise of religion). Or they can require the defendant to repair past violations of the law. An
        injunction can require someone to do something, like clean up an oil spill or remove a spite fence. Or it
        can prohibit someone from doing something, like using an illegally obtained trade secret. An injunction
        that requires conduct is called a "mandatory injunction." An injunction that prohibits conduct is called a
        "prohibitory injunction." Many injunctions are both—that is, they have both mandatory and prohibitory
        components, because they require some conduct and forbid other conduct.
        When an injunction is given, it can be enforced with equitable enforcement mechanisms such as
        contempt. It can also be modified or dissolved (upon a proper motion to the court) if circumstances
        change in the future. These features of the injunction allow a court granting one to manage the behavior
        of the parties. That is the most important distinction between the injunction and another non-monetary
        remedy in American law, the declaratory judgment. Another way these two remedies are distinguished
        is that the declaratory judgment is sometimes available at an earlier point in a dispute than the
        injunction.
        If your school begins building a swimming pool on land that does not belong to it, the city might issue
        an injunction to stop it. An injunction is an official order issued by a judge. (law) a judicial remedy issued
        in order to prohibit a party from doing or continuing to do a certain activity.
        a formal command or admonition.
        an official order given by a court that demands that something must or must not be done.
        (formal) a warning or an order from somebody in authority
        The ordinary members will follow the injunction of the party leadership.
        temporary injunction
        n. a court order prohibiting an action by a party to a lawsuit until there has been a trial or other court
        action. A temporary injunction differs from a "temporary restraining order" which is a short-term, stopgap
        injunction issued pending a hearing, at which time a temporary injunction may be ordered to be in
        force until trial. The purpose of a temporary injunction is to maintain the status quo and prevent
        irreparable damage or change before the legal questions are determined. After the trial the court may
        issue a "permanent injunction" (making the temporary injunction a lasting rule) or "dissolve" (cancel)
        the temporary injunction. At its most basic level an injunction is a court order instructing someone to stop
        engaging in a particular
        type of behavior. Now, while an injunction can be sought as a legal remedy in a variety of situations
        perhaps the most significant would be injunctions for protection.
        law an order given by a court, which tells someone not to do something.
        an court order, usually stating that someone must not do something. Sometimes an injunction orders
        someone to do something.
        An equitable remedy in which a court orders a party to perform, or refrain from performing, a particular
        act. A prohibitory injunction is an order forbidding a party from performing an act; a mandatory
        injunction is an order to perform an act. An injunction may be temporary, in place until judgment is
        entered (called a preliminary injunction in the US and an interim injunction in the UK), or permanent,
        continuing after the conclusion of proceedings either perpetually or until a specified date (a final
        injunction). Courts usually grant injunctions as final remedies only where the applicant demonstrates
        that:
        Its legal right has been infringed (or is about to be infringed).
        Money damages are inadequate compensation.
        An injunction needs to be in clear terms so that a party can understand what it must, or must not, do. If
        a party violates the terms of an injunction, it may be held in contempt of court.
        A prohibitive writ issued by a court of equity, at the suit of a party complainant, directed to a party
        defendant in the action, or to a party made a defendant for that purpose, forbidding the latter to do
        some act, or to permit his servants or agents to do some act, which he is threatening or attempting to
        commit, or restraining him in the continuance thereof, such act being unjust and inequitable, injurious
        to the plaintiff, and not such as can be adequately redressed by an action fit law.
        An injunction is an order by the court for a party to either do, or refrain from doing, a particular act or
        thing. This does not include orders made by the court for a party to make a payment for damages, but
        instead includes things such as:
        transferring a property into somebody else’s name;
        not going near a certain person or space;
        freezing orders – preventing someone from selling certain property; and
        not making publications, such as facebook posts, about someone.
        According to Halsbury: Injunction is such judicial proceedings whereby the order is passed and given to
        any party for doing or not doing any act.
        According to Barmi Dictionary:
        Injunction is such order by which any person is prevented from interfering in the right of another or
        prevented from threatening to interfere in the right of another.
        In State of Rajasthan Vs Randheer Singh (A.I.R. 1972, Rajasthan 241), the High Court of Rajasthan while defining
        injunction has said that the injunction is such specific order of the court which is issued to:
        prevent such wrongful act which has been commenced or to prevent the threatening to commence such
        act.
        Thus injunction is such order of the court which is issued by it, at any stage of the case, to maintain the
        status quo of the disputed property till the final disposal of the case or till further orders.

    <p>Inference: a guess that you make or an opinion that you form based on the information that you have:
        a belief or opinion that you develop from the information that you know. Inferences are steps
        in reasoning, moving from premises to logical consequences; etymologically, the word infer means to
        "carry forward". Inference is theoretically traditionally divided into deduction and induction, a
        distinction that in Europe dates at least to Aristotle (300s BCE). Deduction is inference deriving logical
        conclusions from premises known or assumed to be true, with the laws of valid inference being studied
        in logic. Induction is inference from particular evidence to a universal conclusion. A third type of
        inference is sometimes distinguished, notably by Charles Sanders Peirce,
        contradistinguishing abduction from induction. The process by which a conclusion is inferred from
        multiple observations is called inductive reasoning. The conclusion may be correct or incorrect, or
        correct to within a certain degree of accuracy, or correct in certain situations. Conclusions inferred from
        multiple observations may be tested by additional observations.
        This definition is disputable (due to its lack of clarity. Ref: Oxford English dictionary: "induction ... 3.

        when the "conclusion" is general.

    <br>
    <p> Infliction is when you subject someone to a difficult or unpleasant experience. The infliction of pain on a
        little kid who needs to get a shot is not fun for him or for his parents.

        The noun infliction is good for talking about imposing something negative on someone. You might describe a
        bully's actions against a smaller child as including both the infliction of pain and the infliction of fear. The
        Latin root of infliction is inflictionem, or "a striking against," from inflictus, "to strike or dash against."
        It's important not to confuse infliction with affliction, which means "something that causes pain," but isn't
        done on purpose. </p>

        The word lieu originally comes from the Latin locus, meaning "place," and its meaning has stayed true to its
        origins ever since. Though it does have a standalone definition, "the position or function formerly held by
        another," this noun is most commonly encountered in the phrase "in lieu of," which means, basically, "instead
        of." If you do, get, or give something in lieu, you do, get, or give it instead of something else, because the
        two things are considered to have the same value or importance. in place of; instead of.</p>

    <p> <strong> Jurist </strong> an expert in or writer on law. NORTH AMERICAN
        a lawyer or a judge. an expert in law, especially a judge. an expert in law, esp. a judge. an expert in law. a
        legal scholar versed in civil law or the law of nations. a public official authorized to decide questions
        brought before a court of justice.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p> A jurist is a person with expert knowledge of law; someone who analyzes and comments on law.[1][2] This person
        is usually a specialist legal scholar, mostly (but not always) with a formal qualification in law and often a
        legal practitioner. In the United Kingdom the term "jurist" is mostly used for legal academics, while in the
        United States the term may also be applied to a judge.[3] With reference to Roman law, a "jurist" (in English)
        is a jurisconsult (iurisconsultus).[4]

        The English term jurist is to be distinguished from similar terms in other European languages, where it may be
        synonymous with legal professional, meaning anyone with a professional law degree that qualifies for admission
        to the legal profession, including such positions as judge or attorney. In Germany, Scandinavia and a number of
        other countries jurist denotes someone with a professional law degree, and it may be a protected title, for
        example in Norway. Thus the term can be applied to attorneys, judges and academics, provided that they hold a
        qualifying professional law degree.[5] In Germany – the term "full jurist" is sometimes used informally to
        denote someone who has completed the two state examinations in law that qualify for practising law, to
        distinguish from someone who may have only the first state examination or some other form of legal qualification
        that does not qualify for practising law. </p>
    <br>
    <p> The literal, simplistic definition of a jurist is a person who happens to be learned in the law, such as a legal
        scholar or a lawyer. In actuality, a jurist is an individual who is an expert and does research on
        jurisprudence. Technically, a jurist refers to a noteworthy influential individual such as a judge, a legal
        scholar, or a lawyer whose skill is so well renowned that the individual has attained such an authority that
        their writings and arguments are also seen as a source of law too. An example of this meaning would be a Supreme
        Court Justice.
        It should be noted that although a jurist can be a lawyer, and a lawyer can be a jurist, the two terms are not
        necessarily interchangeable. The jurist is a legal scholar who studies, analyzes, and comments on the law.
        Indeed, their entire work can be done inside a law library. On the other hand, the lawyer is representing
        clients and performs the work for the satisfaction of their clients’ interests. </p>
    <br>
    <p> A jurist is someone who is an expert in details of the legal system. Sometimes the word jurist is used to refer
        specifically to a lawyer or judge. If you love the law, you might want to be a jurist one day.

        If you become a jurist, you'll be a scholar who has studied the details and theories of law. You might work as a
        newspaper's legal expert or a college professor. In the U.S., it's common to refer to a judge or another legal
        professional as a jurist. So you might describe the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court as the top jurist in the
        country. Jurist comes from the Latin ius, "a right or a law." </p>

        will include the payment of any interest or fees.
        Repayment may occur in increments (as in a monthly mortgage payment) or as a lump sum. One of the largest loans
        consumers take out from lenders is a mortgage.
        <b>Key Takeaways:</b> 1) A lender is an individual, a public or private group, or a financial institution that
        makes funds available to a person or business with the expectation that the funds will be repaid.
        2) Repayment includes the payment of any interest or fees.
        3) Repayment may occur in increments (as in a monthly mortgage payment) or as a lump sum.
        Understanding Lenders
        Lenders provide funds for a variety of reasons, such as a home mortgage, an automobile loan, or a small business
        loan. The terms of the loan specify how it must be satisfied (e.g., the repayment period) and the consequences
        of missing payments and default. A lender may go to a collection agency to recover any funds that are past due.
        How Do Lenders Make Loan Decisions?
        Individual borrowers
        Qualifying for a loan depends largely on the borrower’s credit history. The lender examines the borrower’s
        credit report, which details the names of other lenders extending credit (current and previous), the types of
        credit extended, the borrower’s repayment history, and more. The report helps the lender determine whether—based
        on current employment and income—the borrower would be comfortable managing an additional loan payment. As part
        of their decision about creditworthiness, lenders may also use the Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) score in the
        borrower’s credit report.
        <b> Important: </b> The lender may also evaluate the borrower’s debt-to-income (DTI) ratio—which compares
        current and new debt to before-tax income—to determine the borrower’s ability to pay.
        When applying for a secured loan, such as an auto loan or a home equity line of credit (HELOC), the borrower
        pledges collateral. The lender will make an evaluation of the collateral’s full value and subtract any existing
        debt secured by that collateral from its value. The remaining value of the collateral will be the equity that
        affects the lending decision (i.e., the amount of money that the lender could recoup if the asset were
        liquidated).

        The lender also evaluates a borrower’s available capital, which includes savings, investments, and other assets
        that could be used to repay the loan if income is ever cut due to a job loss or other financial challenge. The
        lender may ask what the borrower plans to do with the loan, such as use it to purchase a vehicle or other
        property. Other factors may also be considered, such as environmental or economic conditions. Business borrowers
        Different lenders have different rules and procedures for business borrowers.

        Banks, savings and loans, and credit unions that offer Small Business Administration (SBA) loans must adhere to
        the guidelines of that program.

        Private institutions, angel investors, and venture capitalists lend money based on their own criteria. These
        lenders will also look at the purpose of the business, the character of the business owner, the location of
        business operations, and the projected annual sales and growth for the business.
        5

        Small-business owners prove their ability for loan repayment by providing lenders both personal and business
        balance sheets. The balance sheets detail assets, liabilities, and the net worth of the business and the
        individual. Although business owners may propose a repayment plan, the lender has the final say on the terms.

        Where Can I Get a Small Business Loan?
        One good lender option for small business borrowers is the Small Business Administration (SBA), a U.S.
        government agency that promotes the economy by assisting small businesses with loans and advocacy. The SBA has a
        website and at least one office in every state.

        What Are the Different Types of Mortgage Lenders?
        The three most common options for borrowers seeking a mortgage lender are mortgage brokers, direct lenders
        (e.g., banks and credit unions), and secondary market lenders (e.g., Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac).

        How Can I Get a Mortgage with Bad Credit?
        Getting a mortgage when you have bad credit is possible, but a larger down payment, mortgage insurance, and a
        higher interest rate will likely be required.

        The Bottom Line
        When you need to borrow money for a personal purchase or jumpstart your business, there are many options. When
        choosing a lender, look at their reputation and longevity—banks and other financial institutions are the
        traditional choices, but angel investors and online micro-lenders are gaining popularity. Before borrowing, make
        sure you understand the full breadth of your loan agreement and can afford to repay it.

    <p> What is a Lender?
        A lender is defined as a business or financial institution that extends credit to companies and individuals,
        with the expectation that the full amount of the loan will be repaid. The lender earns interest on the credit,
        which is charged at a specific percentage of the total amount of loan extended to the borrower. The loan
        repayment may occur in installments, such as monthly repayments or a lump sum payment at a later date. The
        lender provides credit that can be used for various purposes, such as financing working capital, student loan,
        or business capital. Businesses can also borrow credit to provide a backup line of credit to the business, where
        the cash flows generated are irregular. </p>
    <br>
    <p> <b> Summary: </b> A lender is a financial institution that lends money to a corporate or an individual borrower
        with the expectation that the money will be repaid at a later date.
        Lenders require borrowers to pay interest on the amount borrowed, usually charged at a specific percentage of
        the total amount of loan.
        A lender can be a person, group, or business that specializes in providing loans to individuals and
        corporations. </p>
    <br>
    <p> The Lending Process
        The process of lending may be initiated by either the lender or the borrower. Most commonly, the borrower
        approaches the bank for a loan and is required to fill a loan application form. The information needed in the
        application includes the amount of loan requested, the intended use, current cash flows or income, the physical
        address of the borrower, names and addresses of guarantors, etc.

        The bank may also approach an individual or corporation with a proposal to lend them credit at certain terms.
        The potential borrowers, in such a case, are often high net worth individuals and high-growth businesses that
        may be in regular need of credit for investment or funding working capital. </p>
    <br>
    <p> Types of Lenders: 1. Traditional lenders
        Traditional lenders mainly include banks, credit unions, and other financial institutions that provide loans to
        small and medium-sized businesses. Generally, such lenders offer the best terms of all the available commercial
        lending options, and they are used as a benchmark to compare other alternative lending platforms. However,
        individuals and businesses seeking credit from traditional lending institutions must meet the stringent
        borrowing requirements that are provided by financial institutions.

        2. Alternative lenders
        Alternative lenders enjoy the benefit of relaxed regulations by federal agencies, and they are not subjected to
        the same level of regulation as traditional lenders. Examples of alternative lenders include online lenders,
        peer to peer lenders, and crowdfunding. They mainly provide short-term credit, and they may not require
        borrowers to provide collateral.

        For large amounts of loans, alternative lenders may require borrowers to provide more documentation than
        traditional lenders require. Some of the documentation required includes business and personal financial
        statements, credit reports, business plans, proof of employment, etc.

        The amount of interest charged on the loan depends on whether the loan is secured or unsecured. Unsecured loans
        often attract a higher interest rate than the rate charged by traditional lenders due to the high risk of loss.

        How to Find a Lender?
        When planning to borrow a loan, it is recommended to spend time researching different lenders on the market.
        Each lender offers different terms of loan and interest, and it is only through research that one can determine
        the best ones to approach.

        Start the research based on the type of loan needed since most lenders focus on lending specific types of loans.
        Ask for recommendations from family, friends, advisors, mentors, and colleagues who borrowed money in the past.
        At the very least, pick two different lenders and compare them to determine the most favorable option.

        The best place to start with when borrowing a loan is banks and credit unions. Such financial institutions are a
        good choice if taking out a business loan, home equity loan, personal loan, or auto loan. For bank clients or
        credit union members, approach the credit department to discuss the loan request.

        Factors to Consider when Finding a Lender
        1. Amount of loan
        The amount of credit needed will determine the type of lender that should be approached. For small loans,
        family, friends, and peer-to-peer lenders can be viable options, since there are little to no borrowing
        requirements. For large business loans, approach a bank to see the terms and interest that they offer.

        2. Startup business
        Most commercial banks shy away from lending to startup companies due to the absence of stable cash flows and
        transaction history with the bank. The best places to get a startup business loan are the less traditional types
        of lenders, such as family and friends, crowdfunding, and online lenders.

        3. Pledged assets
        Most lenders require borrowers to provide collateral against the loan provided. If there are business assets
        with verifiable proofs of ownership, loans can be obtained from financial institutions with ease and at better
        terms. Offering assets as collateral provides a level of assurance to the lender that, in case of default, the
        bank can sell or auction the asset to recover the total amount extended as loan. </p>

        public department in exchange for the principal and interest. A lender could be a bank, an insurance company, or
        a government agency. Commonly, the borrowers will submit an application to the lender and explain what the loan
        is for and explain their repaying ability. The lender will access the materials that the borrower submitted and
        will review the credit history and credit score of the borrower. In the U.S. there are three major credit
        bureaus that offer a FICO score, the credit score, which is used to evaluate the borrower. The three main credit
        bureaus are Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion. Typically, the higher the FICO credit score is, the lower the
        interest rate will be offered by the lender. </p>
    <br>
    <p> A lender gives money to a borrower with the agreement that it will be paid back within a certain time.

        While people often think of lenders as banks, many other types of lending organizations exist including:

        Payday lenders
        Leasing companies
        Trust companies
        Credit card companies
        Home equity banks
        Private equity firms
        Development banks
        Family trusts
        Provincial agencies
        Municipal agencies
        Retailers
        Utility companies
        Equipment companies
        Auto companies
        Trade vendors/suppliers
        Individuals
        A lender must always be repaid for a loan. If payments are not made as agreed, the lender can use the legal
        system to recover its money. </p>

    <p> What does Lender mean?
        A financier who lends money to a borrower. To be distinguished from a receivables purchaser who provides funding
        through the purchase of receivables.</p>
    <br>
    <p> DEFINITION
        A lender is an institution, group, or individual that loans money to borrowers for various reasons. Lenders
        expect to be repaid on a specific schedule, usually with interest. </p>
    <br>
    <p> Key Takeaways
        Lenders are individuals, groups, or institutions that let you borrow money for a set period of time and repay it
        with interest.
        They come in various forms, from banks and credit unions to friends and family and specialized institutions.
        Always compare several options to find the best deal when you're in the market for a loan. </p>
    <br>
    <p> Definition and Example of a Lender
        Lenders enable individuals and businesses to accomplish things they wouldn't be able to do without taking out a
        loan. It could be a bank lending you money for a 30-year mortgage, or it could be an individual letting a small
        business borrow startup money on a short-term repayment plan. A lender can grant the money to make it happen,
        whatever the need.

        Borrowers must meet certain criteria in terms of cash on hand, credit score, and collateral for this reason.
        Lenders are looking for assurances that you'll be able to repay the loan.

        The terms of your loan agreement will describe exactly how the process works after you've been approved by a
        lender: how often you’ll make payments, how long you have to repay, how much interest you’ll pay, and what
        happens if you fail to repay. It’s helpful to evaluate all of these factors in advance so you’ll know what
        you’re getting into. They'll tell you how much each loan costs. </p>
    <br>
    <p> Note
        It's important to look beyond the monthly payment when you're sizing up a loan offer. Evaluate the total cost of
        the loan and how it will impact you financially. <br>
        <b> How Finding a Lender Works: </b>
        It’s almost always a good idea to shop around for a loan. Your best deal might not be with the first lender you
        talk to. You can’t necessarily count on the biggest advertisers or brand names to deliver the best deals. The
        only way to know you’re getting a good deal is to talk with several lenders and compare your options.

        The type of loan you need will determine how many choices you have. Some organizations don’t do student loans,
        but you'll have plenty of options for other loans, such as personal loans. You'll have to fill out a few loan
        applications to find the best deal. Ask somebody with professional experience about the type of loan in question
        if possible, such as a trusted real estate agent, if you need a home loan.1

        Types of Lenders
        You have many options when it comes to finding the right lender for your needs.

        Banks and Credit Unions
        If the financial institution you work with doesn’t lend money, it’s a safe bet that it can suggest a reputable
        lender who does offer what you need. Banks and credit unions are a good choice for:

        Personal loans
        Auto loans
        Credit cards
        Home equity loans and lines of credit
        Small business loans
        Some mortgages
        Loans From Friends, Family, and Peer-to-Peer Loans
        You might find that you have better luck getting approved, or you may pay less if you borrow from alternative
        sources. Sometimes family and friends can make good lenders, but borrowing from them can be risky.

        Peer-to-peer loans can help you skip the bank without putting relationships in jeopardy, but it's only safe to
        borrow from online lenders if you use well-known, reputable sites. There are plenty of predatory lenders out
        there that are looking to take advantage of unsuspecting borrowers.2

        Note
        Money can sour otherwise good relationships, so think carefully before borrowing from a loved one.

        You’ll need a lender that specializes in a particular type of lending for some loans.

        Student Loan Lenders
        Visit your financial aid office if you need to borrow for school. They’ll explain your options and help you
        start the process. It’s usually best to start with loans from the U.S. government. They come with certain
        benefits in terms of more lenient repayment terms and lower rates. You can borrow from private lenders if
        necessary.

        Mortgage Lenders (Purchase and Refinancing)
        You have several choices if you’re borrowing to buy a home, refinance, or take out home equity. A mortgage
        broker isn't a lender, but they may have relationships with numerous lenders. They can help you shop, although
        it’s still a good idea to compare any mortgage broker to at least one alternative. Your bank or credit union may
        also have resources, whether they lend directly or employ mortgage brokers and loan officers.

        Construction loans come from specialized lenders, as well as banks and credit unions, if you're buying land,
        building, or renovating.

        Alternative Sources
        These sources should take care of most loans you’ll ever need, but certain situations might lead you to other
        types of lenders. Your costs and risks generally increase as you stray off the beaten path, so you should only
        do so when it’s really necessary.

        Hard money lenders offer short-term financing for real estate investors, but most homeowners are better off with
        traditional mortgage lenders. Payday loans and title loans provide small amounts of short-term cash at a high
        cost. Furniture, appliance, and department stores may also offer to finance purchases, but you can often find
        better terms elsewhere.

        Lender Requirements for Borrowers
        Every lender will have its own set of criteria that it uses to evaluate whether you qualify for a loan and what
        terms it will offer you if you do. It will generally come down to factors such as your credit score, the amount
        of money you're looking to borrow, how much you're already borrowing on other loans, the length of the loan, and
        any assets you can offer as collateral.

    <p> Difference between a lender and creditor
        The primary users of financial statements are lenders, creditors, and investors. Many students struggled to
        understand the fundamental difference between a lender and creditor.

        A lender is typically a bank where their business is to supply money in exchange for interest. A lender may or
        may not have an active loan with a company, but if the company wants to receive a loan, then the lender would be
        a primary user.

        Creditors would be any institution, individual, or company that the company owes money to. So if a lender makes
        a loan to a company, then they would become a creditor. A creditor could also be suppliers or vendors that the
        company owes money to. If you gave the company a loan, you would be a creditor.

        Ultimately, any entity or individual that is owed money by a company would be a creditor. </p>
    <br>
    <p> What is the difference between a mortgage broker and a mortgage lender? A lender is a financial institution that
        makes loans directly to you. A broker does not lend money. A broker finds a lender. A broker may work with many
        lenders. </p>

    <p>What Is a Liability? (jis Par) Zimadari (banti hai Qarz ada karnay ki yaa jis par Qarz wajib ul ada ho)
        A liability is something a person or company owes, usually a sum of money. Liabilities are settled over
        time through the transfer of economic benefits including money, goods, or services.
        Recorded on the right side of the balance sheet, liabilities include loans, accounts payable, mortgages,
        deferred revenues, bonds, warranties, and accrued expenses.
        Liabilities can be contrasted with assets. Liabilities refer to things that you owe or have borrowed; assets
        are things that you own or are owed.
        KEY TAKEAWAYS
        A liability (generally speaking) is something that is owed to somebody else.
        Liability can also mean a legal or regulatory risk or obligation.
        In accounting, companies book liabilities in opposition to assets.
        Current liabilities are a company's short-term financial obligations that are due within one year or a
        normal operating cycle (e.g. accounts payable).Long-term (non-current) liabilities are obligations listed on the
        balance sheet not due for more than a
        year.
        Other Definitions of Liability
        Generally, liability refers to the state of being responsible for something, and this term can refer to any
        money or service owed to another party.
        Important:
        Liability may also refer to the legal liability of a business or individual. For example, many businesses
        take out liability insurance in case a customer or employee sues them for negligence.</p>

    <br>
    <p> Lunatic is a term referring to a person who is seen as mentally ill, dangerous, foolish, or crazy—conditions
        once attributed to "lunacy". The word derives from lunaticus meaning "of the moon" or "moonstruck". The term
        "lunatic" derives from the Latin word lunaticus, which originally referred mainly to epilepsy and madness, as
        diseases thought to be caused by the moon. The King James Version of the Bible records "lunatick"
        in the Gospel of Matthew, which has been interpreted as a reference to epilepsy. By the fourth and fifth
        centuries[clarification needed], astrologers were commonly using the term to refer to neurological and
        psychiatric diseases. Pliny the Elder argued that the full moon induced individuals to lunacy and
        epilepsy by effects on the brain analogous to the nocturnal dew. Until at least 1700, it was also a common
        belief that the moon influenced fevers, rheumatism, episodes of epilepsy and other diseases. There is also a
        Greek goddess named luna. </p>
    <br>
    <p> <b> Use of the term "lunatic" in legislation: </b> In the jurisdiction of England and Wales the Lunacy Acts
        1890–1922 referred to "lunatics", but the Mental Treatment Act 1930 changed the legal term to "person of unsound
        mind", an expression which was replaced under the Mental Health Act 1959 by "mental illness". "Person of unsound
        mind" was the term used in 1950 in the English version of the European Convention on Human Rights as one of the
        types of person who could be deprived of liberty by a judicial process. The 1930 Act also replaced the term
        "asylum" with "mental hospital". Criminal lunatics became Broadmoor patients in 1948 under the National Health
        Service Act 1946.

        On December 5, 2012, the US House of Representatives passed legislation approved earlier by the US Senate
        removing the word "lunatic" from all federal laws in the United States. President Barack Obama signed the
        21st Century Language Act of 2012 into law on December 28, 2012.

        "Of unsound mind" or non compos mentis are alternatives to "lunatic", the most conspicuous term used for
        insanity in the law in the late 19th century. </p>
    <br>
    <p> <b> Astronomy: </b> The term lunatic was sometimes used to describe those who sought to discover a reliable
        method of determining longitude (before John Harrison developed the marine chronometer method of determining
        longitude, the main theory was the Method of Lunar Distances, advanced by Astronomer Royal Nevil Maskelyne). The
        artist William Hogarth portrayed a "longitude lunatic" in the eight scene of his 1733 work A Rake's
        Progress.Twenty years later, though, Hogarth described John Harrison's H-1 chronometer as "one of the most
        exquisite movements ever made."

        Later, members of the Lunar Society of Birmingham called themselves lunaticks. In an age with little street
        lighting, the society met on or near the night of the full moon. </p>

        the process of causing a disagreement to be discussed in a court of law so that an official decision can be made
        about it: Litigation is the process of resolving disputes by filing or answering a complaint through the public
        court system.

        In federal courts, litigation is governed by a number of federal rules: the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,
        the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, the Federal Rules of
        Bankruptcy Procedure, and the Federal Rules of Evidence. These are supplemented by the local rules of each court
        and the standing orders of judges.

        Major Steps in a Civil Case
        Plaintiff commences civil action by filing a complaint with the clerk of the court.
        Personal jurisdiction is obtained over the defendant (e.g. by means of service of process).
        The parties meet and confer with one another in order to identify issues, discuss the possibility of settlement,
        and prepare a plan for discovery and disclosure.
        The court conducts an early pretrial conference (scheduling conference) or else issues a pretrial scheduling
        order.
        Defendant may file motions.
        Some motions must be filed in the first responsive pleading of the defendant.
        Other motions may be filed later.
        Defendant files an answer.
        Parties disclose documents and the discovery process moves forward.
        Either party may file any additional motions.
        The court holds the final pre-trial conference.
        The court conducts trial.
        The court renders, signs, and files the judgment.
        Post-trial proceedings may or may not occur.
        Appeal may be taken.
        Depending on the situation, judgment may or may not be stayed.
        Appeal is considered based on either briefs or after oral argument.
        Judgment is rendered on the appeal.
        Supplementary proceedings may or may not occur.
        Judgment is enforced. </p>

    <p> Litigation is a formal process during which legal disputes are resolved. Individuals can use the civil court
        system to address a wide variety of issues ranging from personal injury claims to divorces to disputes
        surrounding a breach of contract.

        Litigation can occur in state or federal court. Either way, there are specific rules— called rules of civil
        procedure—governing every step of the process. If you become involved in litigation as either a plaintiff or a
        defendant, it is a good idea to hire an experienced attorney who has handled similar matters.

        This guide to litigation helps you understand what to expect during the process and possible outcomes of
        litigation.

        What Is Litigation?
        In the United States, anyone can seek a remedy in the public court system.

        A plaintiff (a person who initiates a case and makes a formal legal complaint) files paperwork with the court to
        get the process started. The defendant (the person who the plaintiff has a legal issue with) is required to come
        to court if the court has authority (jurisdiction) over them.

        When a plaintiff initiates a legal claim, the plaintiff has the burden of providing evidence and proving their
        case.

        The defendant can ask for the case to be dismissed if there is insufficient evidence to proceed or can raise
        defenses and argue that the plaintiff’s evidence is not true or doesn’t meet the legal requirements.

        A judge or a jury will then make a decision on the outcome of the case, which the parties are bound by unless it
        is overturned on appeal.

        The Litigation Process
        There are different steps to the litigation process, which may vary slightly depending on the court the claim is
        filed in and the nature of the case. In general, however, this is the basic process involved in litigation:

        A plaintiff files a complaint with the court. The plaintiff must state the legal grounds their action is based
        on. For example, a plaintiff could petition for divorce or could make a personal injury claim under tort laws
        alleging a negligent defendant harmed them.
        A defendant is served with court paperwork (or waives service of process if applicable). The court must have
        jurisdiction over the parties and over the case. This means the plaintiff and/or defendant must have sufficient
        connection to the area (such as by living or doing business in the area where the claim was filed) and that the
        court must have legal authority to decide on the issues raised by the case.
        The defendant may file an answer. This means the defendant has the ability to respond to the complaint the
        plaintiff has made.
        Initial motions are filed. The parties file motions, which are requests they want to make to the court. The
        defendant can file counterclaims, which means they raise separate legal claims against the plaintiff.
        The discovery process unfolds. The parties exchange evidence during discovery. Either party may file motions
        asking the court to require the other party to produce specific relevant evidence. For example, a plaintiff
        could ask the court to compel the defendant to turn over financial statements they believe are being hidden.
        Pre-trial conferences take place: Usually, there are several pre-trial conferences throughout the process.
        During these conferences, scheduling issues are addressed and the parties have a chance to talk and consider
        settlement options.
        A trial takes place. Both parties call witnesses, cross-examine each other’s witnesses and present evidence. The
        plaintiff presents first and has the legal burden of proving their claim. The defendant has the opportunity to
        raise defenses, call the plaintiff’s evidence into question or ask for the case to be dismissed if there’s not
        enough evidence. There is a specific burden of proof applied to the plaintiff. For example, in most personal
        injury claims, a plaintiff must prove their case by a preponderance of the evidence, or show that more likely
        than not their claims against the defendant are true and valid legal claims.
        A judgment is entered. A judge or a jury decides the case.
        One or more parties may appeal. This means they ask an appeals court to reconsider decisions made on legal (but
        generally not factual) issues raised in the original case. For example, a plaintiff or defendant could ask the
        appeals court to consider whether evidence should have been ruled admissible or whether the law was applied
        correctly, but not to reconsider whether a particular witness presented compelling testimony or not.
        Judgment is enforced. If there are no successful appeals, the judgment is enforced.
        Every step of this process requires following complex rules of evidence, ensuring you’ve submitted the proper
        court paperwork and complying with court deadlines. You should have an experienced attorney helping you
        throughout the entire litigation process.

        Outcomes of Litigation
        The outcomes of litigation vary depending on the specific situation and type of case.

        For example, a court could find for a plaintiff in a personal injury case and the defendant would be ordered to
        provide compensation to the plaintiff for injuries. Or the court could find for a defendant and determine that
        the plaintiff is not entitled to compensation.

        In other types of cases, such as litigated divorces, the court makes decisions on issues related to custody,
        alimony, child support and division of property.

        Alternatives to Litigation
        Litigation can be an expensive process that is stressful for all involved parties. As a result, many different
        types of cases that could be resolved through litigation end up being decided through out-of-court settlements.

        For example, a defendant’s insurer could offer an injured plaintiff a lump sum of money to resolve a personal
        injury claim. If the plaintiff accepts, they give up their right to make further claims. No litigation would be
        necessary.

        A divorcing couple could opt for an uncontested divorce. They could draft their own divorce settlement agreement
        and ask the judge to approve it and dissolve their marriage rather than having the judge decide issues related
        to custody, property division or support. This simple uncontested divorce wouldn’t require litigation.

        It is a good idea to consider whether these alternatives to litigation could provide better outcomes for you. An
        experienced attorney can help you to negotiate an out-of-court settlement, help you through the process of an
        uncontested divorce or otherwise assist you in finding ways to resolve your case without going to court.

        Get Help During the Litigation Process
        If you are going through the litigation process, you need a lawyer with experience handling claims similar to
        yours. This could be a divorce lawyer, a medical malpractice lawyer, a car accident lawyer or an attorney with
        one of dozens of other legal specialties. Your attorney will be there for you at every step of litigation, from
        settlement negotiations to appeals to give you the best chance of getting your desired outcome through the civil
        court system. </p>
    <br>
    <p> Litigation is generally thought of as the process of resolving rights-based disputes through the court system,
        from filing a law suit through arguments on legal motions, a discovery phase involving formal exchange of
        information, courtroom trial and appeal. Litigation also encompasses administrative or regulatory processes for
        establishing legal rights and resolving disputes. Even if you do not plan to be a litigator, some familiarity
        with the litigation process will help you advise clients on how best to avoid disputes regarding legal rights.
        Many legal disputes are resolved through direct negotiation, often based on a lawyer's advice, but without
        formally filing a claim to commence litigation. In fact, only a small percentage of litigated cases proceed
        through trial. Most are settled through negotiation, mediation, arbitration or other forms of alternative
        dispute resolution (ADR). In mediation, a neutral mediator assists the parties' efforts to reach a settlement,
        but does not have binding decision-making power. Arbitration is a relatively informal adjudicative process in
        which the arbitrator's decision is usually binding. A wide range of contracts include mandatory mediation or
        arbitration provisions and many court-related programs offer one or more forms of ADR.

        Students in litigation and ADR practice should gain a thorough understanding of these processes, as well as
        grounding in the skills required for becoming an effective advocate.

        Process is insufficient without substantive legal knowledge. Thus, students are advised to take classes in the
        substantive legal areas in which they intend to practice. However, the good news is that litigators can also be
        generalists, and a well-rounded legal education will serve them well.

    <br>
    <p> According to Legal Dictionary, the definition of litigation is as follows, “When a person, business, or entity
        enters into a lawsuit, whether they have filed the lawsuit, or are responding to it, they are entering into a
        process known as “litigation.” Lawsuits or “actions” are brought before the court for the purpose of enforcing a
        particular right. The process of litigation is actually a series of steps taken to resolve the matter, whether
        through negotiations toward a settlement, or a court trial.” Common forms of general litigation
        There are a number of different forms of general litigation. Whilst they are all different, certain aspects of
        them can also overlap. Plaintiff Personal Injury
        In law, the plaintiff is defined as the person that brings a lawsuit against someone else. The term itself is no
        longer used in UK law, where the person bringing the claim is now referred to as a ‘Claimant’. In terms of
        personal injury, this will usually be the person who has been injured and feels that they need compensation from
        the person that they believe was responsible for the injury.

        In personal injury cases, compensation can be sought for a range of different aspects that have been suffered as
        a result of the accident. These can include:

        Compensation for pain and suffering
        Compensation for loss of the enjoyment of life
        Lost wages
        Damage to property
        Wrongful death
        Compensation for loss of earning capacity
        Medical bills and expenses
        Permanent or long-term disability
        Mental distress
        In these cases, the plaintiff, or Claimant, must demonstrate that the actions of the accused (the defendant)
        caused the personal injury.

        Workers’ Compensation
        Workers’ compensation is in place for people who are injured, killed, or suffer illness as a result of
        carelessness, negligence, or lack of training at work.

        Workers’ compensation is usually claimed by people who suffer physical personal injury at work, but it can also
        be used to claim for compensation for issues such as bullying, discrimination, harassment, unfair dismissal, and
        stress.

        All employers in the UK must have Employers Liability Insurance to enable them to be able to pay out any
        compensation that is due, and if you believe that you have a case against an employer, it is important to get
        the guidance of a legal professional.

        Labour Disputes
        If you believe that you have been wronged at work and that you have a case against your employer in terms of
        professional negligence, breach of contract, or general business disputes, for example, you can look into
        litigation.

        In this case, you should normally speak to a lawyer, presenting them with the evidence that you have against
        your employer and they will advise you on the next steps to take. It is often the case that businesses will look
        to settle these disputes through mediation and before it goes to court as it can be damaging to their
        reputations.

        Corporate Litigation
        In the UK, corporate litigation comes under corporate law. It gives investors the right to protect themselves
        against a wrong in the company such as a board of directors. Generally speaking, the plaintiff in corporate
        litigation is a shareholder, director, or member. We sometimes see business partners suing each other, for fraud
        or breach of contract, for example.

        Corporate litigation can also cover copyright issues, breach of fiduciary duty, trademark infringement, and
        unfair competition.

        Collection Litigation
        Collection litigation refers to the collection of money that is payable to someone. Lawyers will always try to
        obtain the money that is owed to their clients by other means before it goes to court, but in some cases, this
        is the most effective way of collecting the money that is owed to them. </p>
    <br>
    <p> What is litigation?
        Litigation is the process of taking a dispute to a court of law. If parties cannot agree between themselves
        about the fair and proper outcome of a dispute they will present their respective cases to a court for its
        judgment. It is a broad term that describes a long and sometimes complex process. In this article, we will break
        down the stages in the litigation process.

        What kind of cases can be resolved using litigation?
        There are a wide range of cases which can be resolved using litigation. These can include:

        Commercial disputes e.g. claims for breach of contract such as damaged goods or recovery of debts;
        Matrimonial matters e.g. determining the extent of a spousal claim in a divorce action;
        Claims against the state e.g. A judicial review of a planning decision;
        Personal injury claims e.g. monetary claims arising out of an accident where a person suffered harm;
        Employment disputes e.g. a claim for wrongful dismissal.
        Which is the right court for me?
        You may be aware that there are a number of different courts and tribunals in the British legal system. The
        decision as to which court or tribunal to approach will depend on the particular facts of your dispute and
        whether there is a specialist court or tribunal set up for your specific type of case. Your solicitor will
        advise you on which of these would be best to approach and the considerations informing this decision can
        include:

        The value of your claim. If your claim is valued at less than £100,000 then the case will be commenced in the
        county court. If it is valued at more than £100,000 it can be brought in the High Court;
        Nature of the claim. If your case will involve the assessment of complex and technical evidence then you may
        approach a specialist court like the Technology and Construction Court which hears cases involving disputes over
        buildings, engineering or surveying.
        Who can approach a British Court?
        The right to approach a court to resolve a dispute is a fundamental human right. However, that does not mean
        that anyone can bring any claim in a British court. This question is determined by considering whether a
        particular court has jurisdiction over a person or a claim.

        A common clause in many international contracts is along the lines of, “in the event of a dispute the law of
        England and Wales will apply”. This does not mean that the British court has jurisdiction. All it means is that
        in resolving a dispute the law to determine obligations will be that of England and Wales.

        As a general rule, the defendant must reside within a court’s physical jurisdiction or the cause of action must
        have arisen within a court’s jurisdiction. This is a complex area of law and specialist legal advice is often
        necessary to determine whether a particular court has jurisdiction. The consequences of bringing a claim in the
        wrong court is that a claim could be dismissed early on this technical basis without the court having to
        consider the underlying merits of the claim.

        What is the litigation process?
        The litigation process can be divided into three broad stages:

        The issue of proceedings and filing of a defence;
        Pre-trial procedures;
        Trial
        The Civil Procedure Rules, 1998
        The litigation process is governed by The Civil Procedure Rules 1998. This is a comprehensive set of rules which
        inform all aspects of the civil litigation process. The Rules prescribe the time limits within which certain
        steps in the litigation process must be undertaken, the correct forms to use and the obligations on the parties
        to litigation to narrow the issues in dispute. Please note that other areas of dispute, such as matrimonial
        disputes, may have their own set of procedural rules to follow.

        The overriding objective of the rules is to resolve disputes justly and by the most efficient means possible.
        Parties can be penalised for failing to comply with these rules by costs orders against them or in the most
        extreme cases having their claims or defences “struck out”. This means that they can no longer continue in the
        process and “lose” by default.

        These procedural rules can be complex and while there is no obligation on parties to have legal representation,
        the High Court has held that litigants in person (i.e. individuals representing themselves) will not be given
        any special treatment in respect of their obligations to comply with the rules, court orders and timeframes.

        The first stage: issue of proceedings and filing of defence
        Legal proceedings commence by the formal service of a claim on a defendant. The claimant’s case will be set out
        in two documents

        Claim form – which sets out the names of the parties and the bare details of the claim;
        Statement of case – this document sets out the full details of the claim including the facts which support the
        claim being made.
        The length and complexity of a statement of case will depend on the facts of each case. This document does not
        contain evidence because its purpose is to set out in clear terms the facts which the claimant allege, if
        proved, will justify the relief sought in the case and the full legal basis for the claim. The defendant must be
        fully informed of the case they have to answer.

        A defendant served with a claim form and a statement of case must, within the time periods prescribed by the
        Civil Procedure Rules, either object to some technical aspect of the claimant’s case or deliver its defence. The
        technical term which you may come across is “pleadings”. This refers to the claim document and the defence (also
        known as a “plea”) and any reply to the defence.

        Objections to Claim
        It may happen that the statement of case has some serious defects which means that a defendant cannot deliver a
        defence or has been advised that it is not necessary to do so. The reasons for this could include:

        The facts, as pleaded in the statement of case, do not support a cause of action (i.e. a legal basis for
        bringing a claim);
        The court in which the claim has been brought does not have jurisdiction to hear the claim;
        The facts have not been properly pleaded and the defendant requires more information before they can file a
        defence.
        These objections are raised by a formal notice. The claimant can either amend its claim or a court will hear
        argument on the objections and make a decision on whether the claim can proceed.

        The defence
        This pleading deals with the facts alleged and either admits or denies them. A defendant could allege additional
        facts which it says is relevant to the determination of the claim. A claimant may, in addition, deliver a “reply
        to the defence” to deal with these additional facts.

        Pre-trial procedures
        Once the pleadings are filed, the parties will have a fair idea of which issues of fact or conclusions of law
        are in dispute. The purpose of the pre-trial procedures is to:

        Narrow the issues in dispute between the parties;
        Disclose to the other party all the documents in their possession or control which are relevant to the case
        (which either support or are adverse to their case);
        Prepare for trial e.g. estimate the number of days required;
        Explore the possibility of settlement.
        The procedures for the above are set out in detail in the Civil Procedure Rules. It is vital that both parties
        engage with each other in a civil and co-operative manner. If a party is shown to be obstructive or evading its
        obligations under these rules, then they could face a penalty for costs even if they are ultimately successful
        in the action.

        The trial
        Trials are held in open court and heard by one judicial officer. As part of the pre-trial procedure the parties
        will have estimated the number of court days required to hear all the evidence and argument. The court
        administrators will serve a notice on the parties advising them of the date and time of the trial. It will be
        the responsibility of the legal representatives or the litigant in person to ensure that they are properly
        prepared to start on the allocated day and that all of their witnesses are at court to give evidence if
        necessary.

        The judgment
        Once the court has heard the evidence and argument as to the correct legal conclusion based on the evidence, it
        will make its decision. This is known as a judgment. It is usually in writing and will set out the facts the
        court found proved and the legal conclusion based on those facts. The judgment will also contain a direction as
        to who should pay the costs of the litigation.

        An appeal
        If the parties are not satisfied with the outcome one (or sometimes both) can apply to appeal the judgment to a
        higher court. An appeal court will, as a general rule, not interfere with findings of fact made by the first
        judge (because that judge had the opportunity to observe the witnesses and make decisions about their
        credibility) but it could disagree with the judge’s legal conclusions and either overturn or vary the original
        finding.

        Costs
        Litigation can be an extremely expensive undertaking. While it is true that in most cases the successful party
        can claim its legal costs from the other it is unlikely that a party would be able to recover all of its legal
        costs. The costs can be divided into two broad categories:

        Court costs which are the administrative fees payable to the Ministry of Justice in order to bring a claim.
        These vary in accordance with the value of the claim.
        Costs of legal representation. These are the fees charged by your solicitor to act for you in a matter. These
        too can vary in accordance with the type of claim and the level of seniority of your legal representative. It is
        very important to discuss how you will fund litigation with your solicitor.

        a magnanimous act
        the quality of being magnanimous.
        a magnanimous act. Magnanimity (from Latin magnanimitās, from magna "big" + animus "soul, spirit") is the virtue
        of being
        great of mind and heart. It encompasses, usually, a refusal to be petty, a willingness to face danger, and
        actions for noble purposes. The Latin word magnanimitās is a calque of the Greek
        word μεγαλοψυχία (megalopsychia), which means "greatness of
        soul". Aristotle associates megalopsychia more with a sense of pride and self-worth rather than the
        modern sense of magnanimity. He writes, "Now a person is thought to be great-souled if he claims much
        and deserves much". Aristotle continues:[3]
        He that claims less than he deserves is small-souled... For the great-souled man is justified in despising
        other people—his estimates are correct; but most proud men have no good ground for their pride... It is
        also characteristic of the great-souled man never to ask help from others, or only with reluctance, but to
        render aid willingly; and to be haughty towards men of position and fortune, but courteous towards
        those of moderate station... He must be open both in love and in hate, since concealment shows
        timidity; and care more for the truth than for what people will think; and speak and act openly, since as
        he despises other men he is outspoken and frank, except when speaking with ironical self-depreciation,
        as he does to common people... He does not bear a grudge, for it is not a mark of greatness of soul to
        recall things against people, especially the wrongs they have done you, but rather to overlook them...
        Such then being the Great-souled man, the corresponding character on the side of deficiency is the
        Small-souled man, and on that of excess the Vain man.
        W.D. Ross translates Aristotle's statementas the following: "Pride [megalopsychia], then, seems to be a
        sort of crown of the virtues; for it makes them greater, and it is not found without them." Noah
        Webster defined Magnanimity in this way:
        Greatness of mind; that elevation or dignity of soul, which encounters danger and trouble with
        tranquility and firmness, which raises the possessor above revenge, and makes him delight in acts of
        benevolence, which makes him disdain injustice and meanness, and prompts him to sacrifice personal
        ease, interest and safety for the accomplishment of useful and noble objects.
        — Noah Webster[6]
        Thomas Aquinas adopted Aristotle's concept while adding the Christian virtues of humility and
        charity.[7]
        Edmund Spenser, in The Faerie Queene, had each knight allegorically represent a virtue. Prince Arthur
        represented "magnificence", which is generally taken to mean Aristotelian magnificence.[8] The
        uncompleted work does not include Prince Arthur's book, and the significance is not clear.
        Democritus states that "It is magnanimity to bear untowardness calmly".[9]
        Thomas Hobbes defines magnanimity as "contempt of little helps and hindrances" to one's ends. To
        Hobbes, contempt stands for an immobility of the heart, which is moved by other things and desires
        instead.[10]
        As an adjective, the concept is expressed as "magnanimous", e.g. "He is a magnanimous man." An
        example of referring to one as magnanimous can be seen in Hrólfs saga kraka where King Hrólfr
        Kraki changes the name of a court servant from Hott to Hjalti for his new-found strength and courage,
        after which Hjalti refuses to taunt or kill those who previously mocked him. Because of his noble actions,
        the king then bestows the title Magnanimous upon Hjalti.
        One form of magnanimity is the generosity of the victor to the defeated. For example, magnanimity has
        been codified between societies by the Geneva Conventions.[citation needed]
        Magnanimous relief efforts can serve to offset the collateral damage of war.
        C. S. Lewis, in his book The Abolition of Man, refers to the chest of man as the seat of magnanimity, or
        sentiment, with this magnanimity working as the liaison between visceral and cerebral man.[11] Lewis
        asserts that, in his time, the denial of the emotions that are found in the eternal and sublime—that
        which is humbling as an objective reality—had led to "men without chests". Barai, hosla, aalmi hosla,

    <p> <strong> Mammon (Taghut): </strong> mammon, biblical term for riches, often used to describe the debasing
        influence of
        material wealth. The term was used by Jesus in his famous Sermon on the Mount and also appears in
        The Gospel According to Luke. Medieval writers commonly interpreted it as an evil demon or god. Since
        the 16th century, mammon has been used to negatively describe the pursuit of wealth and has been
        used in both religious and secular contexts. In English, mammon was used in the King James Version of
        the Bible and persisted as a word in other literature, though most modern Bibles variously use “wealth,”
        “riches,” or “gain.”
        It is sometimes argued that the Aramaic word is transliterated from Hebrew, which is not unreasonable
        given Jesus’ Jewish background. In Mishnaic Hebrew the word mihamon is a contraction of mi, meaning
        “from,” and hāmōn, meaning “accumulation,” and connotes wealth or money. This word is used
        neutrally in the Hebrew Bible as the equivalent to gain and is found in the Dead Sea Scrolls and
        the Talmud.
        Mammon in the New Testament
        There are two passages in the New Testament that use mamōnas. The most famous is part of
        the Sermon on the Mount from Matthew 6:24 (King James Version), in which Jesus asserts, “No man can
        serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one,
        and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.” A similar, longer passage is found
        in Luke 16:9–13 (King James Version), which states,
        And I say unto you, make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail,
        they may receive you into everlasting habitations. He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also
        in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much. If therefore ye have not been faithful in
        the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches? And if ye have not been
        faithful in that which is another man’s, who shall give you that which is your own? No servant can serve
        two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one,
        and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.
        In both Gospels the term is associated with unrighteousness and represents something that is at odds
        with service to God. Given that both passages are contextualized within a discussion of one’s treasures
        in heaven, the word is usually understood as the acquisition of material wealth or the idolatry of
        material riches.
        Evolution of the term
        Over time, the somewhat abstract concept of mammon became more fully personified in art and
        literature. Some scholars, such as St. Gregory of Nyssa, St. John Chrysostom, and Peter Lombard,
        understood Mammon to be a demon. Medieval theologians assigned seven archdemons to the seven
        deadly sins, and Mammon became the demon of greed. Similarly, Mammon was also
        sometimes conflated with the Greek god Plutus and depicted as the seductive god of riches. Famous
        personifications of mammon are found in Ben Jonson’s The Alchemist, John Milton’s Paradise Lost,
        and Edmund Spenser’s The Faerie Queene. The word eventually gained a secular connotation as an allconsuming
        pursuit of wealth and was often used in critiques of capitalism or of wealthy individuals.
        Mammon /ˈmæmən/ in the New Testament of the Bible is commonly thought to mean money,
        material wealth, or any entity that promises wealth, and is associated with the greedy pursuit of gain.The
        Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Luke both quote Jesus using the word in a phrase often
        rendered in English as "You cannot serve both God and mammon."
        In the middle Ages, it was often personified and sometimes included in the seven princes of
        Hell. Mammon in Hebrew ( ממון ) means "money". The word was adopted to Modern Hebrew to mean
        wealth. Taghut, Greed, dhan o daulat. Hirs, lalach, tamaa, and wealth regarded as an evil influence.</p>

        mysticism, the practice of religious ecstasies (religious experiences during alternate states
        of consciousness), together with whatever ideologies, ethics, rites, myths, legends, and magic may be
        related to them.
        Mysticism is popularly known as becoming one with God or the Absolute, but may refer to any kind
        of ecstasy or altered state of consciousness which is given a religious or spiritual meaning. It may also
        refer to the attainment of insight in ultimate or hidden truths, and to human transformation supported
        by various practices and experiences.
        The term "mysticism" has Ancient Greek origins with various historically determined meanings. Derived
        from the Greek word, meaning "to close" or "to conceal", mysticism referred to the biblical, liturgical,
        spiritual, and contemplative dimensions of early and medieval Christianity. During the early modern
        period, the definition of mysticism grew to include a broad range of beliefs and ideologies related to
        "extraordinary experiences and states of mind."In modern times, "mysticism" has acquired a limited definition,
        with broad applications, as meaning the
        aim at the "union with the Absolute, the Infinite, or God". This limited definition has been applied to a
        wide range of religious traditions and practices, valuing "mystical experience" as a key element of
        mysticism.

        friend. If you give her a diamond bracelet, a racehorse, and an oil well, then you’re a munificent friend,
        meaning you are very lavish when it comes to giving gifts. (And it’s possible you may also be broke.)

        If you’re the generous type, you may already know that the word munificent traces back to the Latin word
        munificus, meaning “generous or bountiful," which in turn originated from the word munus, meaning “gift or
        service.” Put those two concepts together and you have big-time gift giving on a lavish scale. Use the word
        munificent to describe instances of over-the-top generosity — think Oprah on a gift-giving binge at
        Christmastime.</p>

    <p>Metaphor: a figure of speech in which a word or phrase is applied to an object or action to which it is
        not literally applicable. a thing regarded as representative or symbolic of something else. an expression,
        often found in literature, that describes a person or object by referring to something that
        is considered to have similar characteristics to that person or object:
        an expression that describes a person or object by referring to something that
        is considered to possess similar characteristics: A metaphor is a figure of speech that describes an object
        or action in a way that isn’t literally true, but helps explain an idea or make a comparison.
        Here are the basics:
        A metaphor states that one thing is another thing
        It equates those two things not because they actually are the same, but for the sake of comparison or
        symbolism
        If you take a metaphor literally, it will probably sound very strange (are there actually any sheep, black
        or otherwise, in your family?)
        Metaphors are used in poetry, literature, and anytime someone wants to add some color to their
        language
        A word or phrase for one thing that is used to refer to another thing in order to show or suggest that
        they are similar
        An object, activity, or idea that is used as a symbol of something else Metaphors are a form of figurative
        language, which refers to words or expressions that mean something
        different from their literal definition. In the case of metaphors, the literal interpretation would often be
        pretty silly.
        a figure of speech in which a word or phrase literally denoting one kind of object or idea is used in place
        of another to suggest a likeness or analogy between them (as in drowning in money)
        broadly : figurative language
        an object, activity, or idea treated as a metaphor. A metaphor is a figure of speech that is used to make
        a comparison, but in a way different from a simile. It makes the comparison as if it was literally true. In
        other words, it can be said that a metaphor is an implied comparison. A metaphor, according to the
        Cambridge Dictionary, is defined as “an expression, often found in literature, that describes a person or
        object by referring to something that is considered to have similar characteristics to that person or
        object.” According to the Oxford Learner’s Dictionary, a metaphor is defined as “a word or phrase used
        to describe somebody/something else, in a way that is different from its normal use, in order to show
        that the two things have the same qualities and to make the description more powerful.” The Collins
        Dictionary defines a metaphor as “an imaginative way of describing something by referring to something
        else which is the same in a particular way”, and according to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, a
        metaphor is “a figure of speech in which a word or phrase literally denoting one kind of object or idea is
        used in place of another to suggest a likeness or analogy between them.” Tashbeeh, istiaaray, kanaye,

    <p>In uses derived from Kantian transcendental logic: the feature of a judgement which determines its classification

        The precise relation of this sense to the older sense 2a is controversial. Kant claimed to derive his
        metaphysical categories from an analysis of the forms of judgement, accordingly adding to the modal concepts of
        possibility and impossibility, necessity and contingency, which corresponded to his ‘problematic’ and
        ‘apodictic’ judgements, those of existence and non-existence, corresponding to his ‘assertoric’ judgements.
        Kant's classification of judgements in logic was taken up by some subsequent logicians, but most recent
        logicians would not treat the propositions corresponding to his assertoric judgements as modally qualified at

    <p>Linguistics: In grammar and semantics, modality refers to linguistic devices that indicate the degree to which an
        observation is possible, probable, likely, certain, permitted, or prohibited. In English, these notions are
        commonly (though not exclusively) expressed by modal auxiliaries, such as can, might, should, and will. They are
        sometimes combined with not.

        Martin J. Endley suggests that "the simplest way to explain modality is to say that it has to do with the stance
        the speaker adopts toward some situation expressed in an utterance...[M]odality reflects the speaker's attitude
        toward the situation being described" ("Linguistic Perspectives on English Grammar," 2010).

        Deborah Cameron illustrates with an example:

        "[Modality] is what makes the difference between a factual assertion like unicorns never existed, and a more
        guarded view, such as it seems unlikely that unicorns could ever have existed—or a bolder claim like the
        existence of unicorns must always have been a myth. Modality, then, is a resource speakers and writers use when
        they are staking claims to knowledge: it allows them to formulate different kinds of claims (e.g., assertions,
        opinions, hypotheses, speculations) and indicate how committed they are to those claims." ("The Teacher's Guide
        to Grammar," Oxford University Press, 2007)
        Indicating Modality Grammatically
        Just as tense indicates a time aspect of a verb, words that are used to show modality indicate the mood of the
        sentence—that is, how factual or assertive the statement is—and it can be done in any number of ways, including
        with adjectives. Martin J. Endley in "Linguistic Perspectives on English Grammar" explains:

        "Thus, a situation might be described as possible, probable, necessary, or certain. The noun counterparts of
        these adjectives also express modality so that a situation can be described as a possibility, a probability, a
        necessity, or a certainty. Moreover, it is possible to use ordinary lexical verbs to convey modality....And
        think about the difference between saying that you know something and saying that you believe something. Such
        differences are essentially a matter of modality. Finally, English also contains certain semi-fixed lexical
        phrases (e.g., rumor has it) that are, basically, modal expressions." (IAP, 2010)
        Other terms that express modality are marginal modals, such as need, ought to, dare, or used to.

        In Depth: Types of Modality
        The range of possibilities expressed when using modality is a broad spectrum, ranging from not very likely to
        very likely; to express these different levels, modality comes with named gradations, as explained by authors
        Günter Radden and René Dirven, in "Cognitive English Grammar":

        "Modality is concerned with the speaker's assessment of, or attitude towards, the potentiality of a state of
        affairs. Modality, therefore, relates to different worlds. Assessments of potentiality, as in You must be right,
        relate to the world of knowledge and reasoning. This type of modality is known as epistemic modality. Modal
        attitudes apply to the world of things and social interaction. This type of modality is known as root modality.
        Root modality comprises three subtypes: deontic modality, intrinsic modality and disposition modality. Deontic
        modality is concerned with the speaker's directive attitude towards an action to be carried out, as in the
        obligation You must go now. Intrinsic modality is concerned with potentialities arising from intrinsic qualities
        of a thing or circumstances, as in The meeting can be canceled, i.e. 'it is possible for the meeting to be
        canceled.' Disposition modality is concerned with a thing's or a person's intrinsic potential of being
        actualised; in particular abilities. Thus, when you have the ability to play the guitar you will potentially do
        so....Modal verbs have a special status among modal expressions: they ground a situation in potential reality."
        (John Benjamins, 2007)
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>This chapter offers a definition of modality that is as concrete and complete as possible. Modality means that
        there is reference to actualization of a situation in a world that is not represented as being the factual
        world. All types of modality are pigeonholed, regardless of whether the ‘modalizer’ is an auxiliary, lexical
        verb, adverb, conditional clause, a morphological operation like ‘modal backshifting’ or ‘conditionalization’,
        etc. Clear definitions are given of root and epistemic modality, and it is shown that not all epistemic values
        are modal values. On the basis of a rich modal world typology and a number of possible relations between a modal
        world and the factual world, different subtypes of modality are distinguished.</p>

    <p>Abstract
        The authors emphasize that the development of language is determined by the development of society. The paper
        deals with semantics and the use of modal words which have specific functional features. The purpose of the
        paper is to study the semantics of modal words, identify main semantic and syntactic features. The units under
        study are adverbs, being indicators of subjective modality. Language is a means of communication performing its
        main function. It is emphasized that language and thinking are inextricably linked, and the results of thinking
        form a close relationship with semantics. One of the most important categories of language is modality as a
        mandatory feature of the utterance. Language modality is relevant in modern linguistics. This phenomenon has its
        own specificity. The research issue is relevant due to the need to clarify semantic possibilities of modal words
        of modern English. The main purpose of the work is to study semantics of modal words, their peculiarities in
        various utterances. The theoretical background are works by V.V. Vinogradov, A.B. Bondarko, O.I. Moskalskaya.
        Currently, linguists are studying modal words and phrases. Because of their specificity and functional features,
        scientists express conflicting opinions on their nature. The paper analyzes the semantics of such modal words as
        certainly, of course, no doubt, surely, apparently, undoubtedly, indeed, obviously, naturally, obviously,
        unhappily, luckily - unluckily, fortunately– unfortunately . The authors come to the conclusion that the
        specificity of the modal meaning of the words is due to the veracity of utterances in relation to reality.

        Introduction
        The development of language is determined by the development of society. Language is a means of communication.
        Language and thinking are inextricably linked, and the results of thinking are associated with semantics.
        Modality is one of the most important categories of language.

        The concept "modality" originated in the philosophical period of Aristotle who distinguished between three types
        of judgments:

        1. Judgment of possibility

        2. Judgment of reality

        3. Judgment of necessity

        These three types of judgments depend on the relationship between the object and its feature.

        The researchers use logical and linguistic approaches.

        1. Modal meanings are not reduced to these three types of relationship, as required by logic. In addition to
        those modal relations, linguistic modality is represented by other types of relations (e.g. reality /
        irreality).

        2. The formal logical doctrine narrowed the problem of the category of modality reducing it to the utterances
        containing only judgments which limited the range of modal meanings. Linguistic modality includes other types of
        utterances (Belyaeva, 1985).

        Language modality is the most important and relevant phenomenon of modern linguistics. This phenomenon is
        characterized by its specificity and diversity of opinions of famous scientists.

        In modern English, modality is expressed with various grammatical, lexical, and intonational means. It is a
        multifaceted, specific linguistic expression and has its own functional features.

        Russian scientists considered the category of modality using various approaches: as a conceptual category
        (Mironov, 1991), as a semantic grammatical category (Didkovskaya, 1991), as a semantic category (Vinogradov,
        1975), as a syntactic category (Nemets, 1991), as a functional semantic category (Bondarko, 1990).

        Belyaeva (1985) defines modality as a subjective objective category of language. This definition reflects the
        objectively subjective nature of the category of modality: subjectivity of the actual assessment of reality is
        limited by objective relationships (which does not mean that everyone who speaks adequately evaluates them).

        Vinogradov (1975) distinguishes between various forms of reaction and evaluates utterances in their relation to
        reality.

        Russian linguists revealed modal meanings and types. So, Zolotova (1973) distinguished between the following
        modal meanings: utterances from the point of view of the speaker, attitude of the speaker to the utterance,
        relation of the actor to the action.

        Panfilov (1977) distinguished between two types of modal meanings: objective and subjective ones. Objective
        modality reflects possible, real and necessary relations, etc. Nemets (1991) believes that being abstract
        objective, modal means express subjective modal relations.

        According to Miloserdova (1991), modal meanings are closely related to their pragmatic meanings.

        “Being the category in which the subjective meaning should be reflected in objective linguistic forms, modality
        is a barometer that must response to the slightest changes in the state of a native speaker and any changes in
        the linguistic system of intellectualization" (Miloserdova, 1991, p. 11).

        Bondarko (1990) considers modality as a functional-semantic field based on multi-level means of language.

        Studying the semantics of partial coincidence of French modal expressions, Thibault (2008) says that although
        there is no consensus on whether French has any true modal auxiliary, is one of the very few possible
        candidates. Most studies of devoir concentrate on criteria for distinguishing its epistemic and root semantic
        values, but some also explore the subtle semantic nuances it conveys depending on context. Here, we identify
        discrete meanings through the analysis of semantic overlaps between devoir and other French modal expressions,
        such as probablement ‘probably’, être supposé ‘to be supposed to’, or falloir ‘ought to’. The analysis of data
        from two corpora on Montreal French, collected in 1971 and 1984, shows that:

        1. There is only one root semantic value exclusively associated with devoir, namely, the notion of desirability
        (as in the English ‘should’).

        2. There are different patterns of use of the competing modal expressions within each semantic field analyzed,
        according to the social class of the speaker. Moreover, some patterns characterizing a specific social group are
        acquired relatively late (Thibault, 2008).

        Problem Statement
        The paper deals with semantics and the use of modal words which have specific functional features.

        Research Questions
        Modal words that have lost their lexical meanings are mentioned as parts of speech in the dictionary of
        linguistic terms. Depending on the subjective attitude to the facts of reality, they are divided into words
        expressing statements, assumptions, subjective assessments (Akhmanova, 2004).

        The semantics of modal words of modern English is a relevant issue.

        Purpose of the Study
        The purpose of the paper is to study the semantics of modal words, identify main semantic and syntactic features
        (Almurzaeva, 2011, 2018).

        Research Methods
        The theoretical background is works by Vinogradov (1975), Bondarko (1971), Moskalskaya (1981).

        The modal words “of course”, “probably”, “perhaps”, “possibly” mean that the speaker does not guarantee accuracy
        of the utterance, since he interprets the state of things as known, taken for granted and considered as facts or
        hypotheses.

        Findings
        The units under study are adverbs. By their semantic meanings, they are indicators of subjective modality
        indicating the degree of credibility:

        - confidence: certainly, surely, surely, inevitably, naturally, of course, no doubt, undoubtedly, indeed,
        really, actually;

        - assumption / guess: apparently ;

        - probability: probably, maybe ;

        - capability: perhaps, possibly;

        - approval or disapproval: fortunately, unfortunately, luckily, unluckily, happily, unhappily.

        The semantic meaning of each word can be revealed within the context:

        Starting your own business is difficult at the moment but you’ll certainly have no problems with it.

        Teacher was amazed and students were certainly surprised too at the behaviour of their classmate.

        Madina is definitely the best English-speaking student in the group.

        There must surely be some reason for his absence at the sport event.

        Those who are created by publicity are inevitably destroyed by it.

        The utterances are interpreted as hypotheses losing the status of facts and acquiring the status of opinions.

        Although these words belong to the same modal group (certainty - confidence), they are not completely identical
        and cannot be interchanged in all contexts.

        For example, in the first sentence, “certainly” can be replaced by “definitely” and “surely”, since all three
        words mean that the speaker is convinced of reliability of the utterance regardless of what others think.

        If the speaker does not doubt the accuracy of the utterance, “definitely” can be used.

        To express the speaker's confidence in what that cannot be avoided, the adverb “inevitably” is used.

        When the speaker emphasizes that he is a guarantor of the statement by virtue of his affiliation with reasonable
        subjects, he uses “of course”.

        It looks as if the Sun goes round the Earth, but, of course, the Earth really goes round the Sun.

        Of course, one can see well all the picture of the mountains from here.

        The teacher told the pupils that the task was to be done immediately, of course.

        Of course, none of them have forgotten to take part in the competition.

        At that time, she really smiled, and all the students smiled too.

        The adverb “naturally” is a modal word that is close in meaning. It means that the guarantor of an assertion is
        the nature of things which includes causal relationships between phenomena.

        The student tried his best, but the examination was a failure. Naturally, he was frustrated.

        The speaker uses the modal words “obviously”, “clearly” and “apparently” (when the facts of objective reality
        guarantee the adequacy of judgment).

        He found his child in bed evidently in pain.

        These two events are evidently closely linked.

        The boy has been bullied at school and he is evidently unhappy.

        For more subjective and emotionally colored utterances, the use of the adverb “obviously” is characteristic.

        She has obviously got a gift for languages.

        One of the rooms has obviously been lived in.

        When using the modal word “apparently”, the speaker emphasizes the fact that he does not have enough grounds for
        unconditional statement.

        We weren’t there but apparently it was a remarkable event.

        The driver managed to climb out of the broken bus, apparently unhurt.

        In the above examples, there was a more or less high degree of probability that the statement is adequate to the
        state of affairs. When the speaker expresses a certain degree of doubt about the reliability of the judgment, he
        uses “perhaps”, “probably”, “possibly”.

        When the utterance about the state of things has the status of subjective perception, “probably” is used.

        This is probably the best thing you can do in this situation.

        When the utterance about the state of affairs is only a hypothesis, “possibly” is used.

        Television is possibly to blame for the degradation of the society.

        The modal word “perhaps” having the same meaning is used more often.

        Kate said nothing of her friend’s visit. Perhaps she had forgotten.

        We have no doubt that he is an honest and noble man.

        Unfortunately, I've heard nothing more of the others.

        Unfortunately, I've got to get going.

        Unfortunately, I am not one of them.

        Fortunately for you ... we're not actually interested in what you did over the last few days.

        And, fortunately, we have plenty of water.

        Fortunately, Irina's marriage is a match made in heaven.

        Fortunately, most of the cities are concentrated on this small continent here.

        happily

        When we married, we vowed to help each other and live happily together.

        And the king and the queen and their daughter lived happily ever after.

        Forty million dollars in the bank, happily married, good health.

        unhappily

        Well, unhappily, it is.

        Unhappily, I know my clients will demand proof of a deposit.

        But, unhappily in this case, yours complicates matters.

        The good ended happily and the bad unhappily.

        I mean, you could always just get your window fixed and buy a new telly, stumble on, unhappily ever after.

        luckily

        Luckily, I was there and scared him off.

        But luckily not everybody said that.

        luckily

        Luckily, the cars come equipped with a GPS tracking device.

        To build one from the ground up would take time, but luckily enough, we can acquire one.

        Luckily, no casualties were reported.

        unluckily

        He's been burnt. He's been one of the unluckiest men alive.

        Either she's the unluckiest woman on the planet... .

        Conclusion
        Having analyzed lexical means of modality, we can conclude that the use of modal words is quite multifaceted.
        Modal words have various additional functions: intensifying, attracting attention, denial, clarification,
        approval, and disapproval. They allow for classification of utterances as real or unreal.

        Thus, specificity of the modal meaning is due to the degree of reliability of the utterance in relation to
        reality. The issue is relevant and requires further research on English modality.

        Magnanimous comes from Latin magnus "great" and animus "soul," so it literally describes someone who is
        big-hearted. A person can show that over-sized spirit by being noble or brave, or by easily forgiving others and
        not showing resentment. It implies superiority, and is something you should say of others rather than of
        yourself. Being magnanimous doesn't require doling out tons of cash — just being an understanding and tolerant
        soul will do the trick. </p>

        noun the position of overlord
        An overlord in the English feudal system was a lord of a manor who had subinfeudated a
        particular manor, estate or fee, to a tenant. The tenant thenceforth owed to the overlord one of a
        variety of services, usually military service or serjeanty, depending on which form of tenure (i.e. feudal
        tenancy contract) the estate was held under. The highest overlord of all, or paramount lord, was
        the monarch, who due to his ancestor William the Conqueror's personal conquest of the Kingdom of
        England, owned[1] by inheritance from him all the land in England under allodial title and had no
        superior overlord, "holding from God and his sword",[2] although certain monarchs, notably King
        John (1199–1216) purported to grant the Kingdom of England to Pope Innocent III, who would thus have
        become overlord to English monarchs.

        goodness and actual goodness. According to American psychological association:
        Prejudice:
        n.
        1. A negative attitude toward another person or group formed in advance of any experience with that
        person or group. Prejudices include an affective component (emotions that range from mild
        nervousness to hatred), a cognitive component (assumptions and beliefs about groups,
        including stereotypes), and a behavioral component (negative behaviors, including discrimination and
        violence). They tend to be resistant to change because they distort the prejudiced individual’s
        perception of information pertaining to the group. Prejudice based on racial grouping is racism;
        prejudice based on sex is sexism; prejudice based on chronological age is ageism; and prejudice based
        on disability is ableism.

        the principle of leaving each state in an empire or federation free to govern itself and promote its own
        interests, without reference to those of the whole.
        THEOLOGY
        the doctrine that some but not all people are elected and redeemed. Particularism refers to exclusive or
        special devotion to a particular interest. It can also refer to a political theory that each political group
        has a right to promote its own interests and especially independence without regard to the interests of
        larger groups. In anthropology, particularism is associated with the work of Franz Boas and his students,
        who emphasized the integrated and distinctive way of life of a given people. Particularism may refer to:
        Epistemological particularism, one of the answers to the problem of the criterion in epistemology
        Historical particularism, an approach in anthropology
        Moral particularism, the view that there are no universal moral principles
        Multicultural particularism, the belief that a common culture for all people is either undesirable or
        impossible
        Political particularism, the politics of group identity that trumps universal rights
        Religious particularism, name given to the phenomenon of Americanism in the apostolic letter Testem
        benevolentiae nostrae. Particularism is a philosophical position that, in brief, claims that reasoning can be
        rational and noncapricious without being structured using principles. (Noncapricious in this context
        means that we do not decide on a whim that a case is of a certain sort; there has to be consistency
        between it and other cases.) The opponents of particular-ists, generalists, deny this claim in various
        ways. Particularism has commonly been applied to reasoning concerned with what people should
        believe (epistemological reasoning) and how people should act (moral and prudential reasoning).

    <p>Sectarianism is a political, cultural, or religious conflict between two
        groups. Prejudice, discrimination, exclusion, or hatred can arise in these conflicts, depending on the
        political status quo and if one group holds more power within the government. Common examples of
        these divisions are denominations of a religion, ethnic identity, class, or region for citizens of a state
        and factions of a political movement.. While sectarianism is often labelled as 'religious' and/or 'political',
        the reality of a sectarian situation is usually much more complex. In its most basic form, sectarianism has
        been defined as, 'the existence, within a locality, of two or more divided and actively competing
        communal identities, resulting in a strong sense of dualism which unremittingly transcends
        commonality, and is both culturally and physically manifest. The term "sectarianism" is defined in the
        Oxford English Dictionary as "excessive attachment to a particular sect or party, especially in
        religion". very strong support for the religious or political group that you are a member of, which
        can cause problems between different groups..</p>

    <p>Parochialism: a limited or narrow outlook, especially focused on a local area; narrow-mindedness.
        the quality of showing interest only in a narrow range of matters, especially those
        that directly affect yourself, your town, or your country: the quality or state of being parochial.
        especially : selfish pettiness or narrowness (as of interests, opinions, or views). Parochialism is the state
        of mind whereby one focuses on small sections of an issue rather than considering its wider context.
        More generally, it consists of being narrow in scope. In that respect, it is a synonym of "provincialism". It
        may, particularly when used pejoratively, be contrasted to cosmopolitanism.[1] The
        term insularity (related to an island) may be similarly used to connote limited exposure. The term
        originates from the idea of a parish (Late Latin: parochia), one of the smaller divisions within many
        Christian churches such as the Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Anglican churches.
        Events, groups and decisions within a parish are based locally — sometimes taking little heed of what is
        going on in the wider Church. A parish can sometimes be excessively focused on the local scale (thus
        within a particular point of view), by having (too) little contact with the broader outside, showing
        meager interest for and possibly knowledge about the universal scale.
        Subsidiarity is an organizing principle that matters ought to be handled by the smallest, lowest or least
        centralized competent authority. The Oxford English Dictionary defines subsidiarity as the idea that a
        central authority should have a subsidiary function, performing only those tasks which cannot be
        performed effectively at a more immediate or local level.
        The term "parochial" can be applied in both culture and economics if a local culture or geographic area's
        government makes decisions based on solely local interests that do not take into account the effect of
        the decision on the broader community. The term may also be applied to decisions and events that are
        considered to be trivial in the grand scheme of things but that may be overemphasized in a smaller
        community, such as disputes between neighbors. Conservative minded. Daqiyanus., bandh zehniyat.</p>

    <p>Predeceased / predecease: die before (another person, typically a relative). to die before someone else:
        to die before (another person). To die first. If one person predeceases another, they die before them.
        to die before (some other person). to die before (someone else). to die before (another person,
        the occurrence of an event, etc.). Predecease means either to die before another person does, or to fail
        to survive another person. It is significant within the field of estates and trusts law when someone who
        is intended to be included as a beneficiary in a will predeceases the person drafting that will,
        the testator. Most jurisdictions have adopted some form of antilapse statute in order to prevent
        a bequest from lapsing in this scenario. However, in situations where an individual predeceases someone who
        eventually dies intestate, or
        without leaving a will, a probate court may apply other mechanisms to determine which descendants
        are to inherit from the estate in accordance with intestate succession statutes. In California, for
        example, Probate Code § 6400–6414 governs what occurs when a spouse predeceases a decedent and
        also governs intestate succession generally. Other mechanisms include estate divisions per stirpes, per
        capita by generation, and per capita with representation.

        LAW
        a restriction making an interest in land inalienable perpetually or for a period beyond certain limits fixed
        by law. Daimi, Daimi qabza, Jagir, ikhlaqiyat.
        in perpetuity: forever.
        What Does Perpetuity Mean in Finance?
        A perpetuity is a security that pays for an infinite amount of time. In finance, perpetuity is a constant
        stream of identical cash flows with no end.
        The concept of perpetuity is also used in several financial theories, such as in the dividend discount
        model (DDM).
        KEY TAKEAWAYS
        A perpetuity, in finance, refers to a security that pays a never-ending cash stream.
        It is essentially an annuity with no termination date.
        The present value of a perpetuity is determined by simply dividing the amount of the regular cash flows
        by the discount rate.
        A growing perpetuity includes a growth rate that increases the cash flows received each period going
        forward.
        Perpetuities today are uncommon financial products, but the concept of a perpetuity is nonetheless
        important in finance.
        Understanding Perpetuity
        An annuity is a stream of cash flows. A perpetuity is a type of annuity that lasts forever, into perpetuity.
        The stream of cash flows continues for an infinite amount of time. In finance, a person uses the
        perpetuity calculation in valuation methodologies to find the present value of a company's cash flows
        when discounted back at a certain rate.
        Perpetuity: Present value = cash flow / Interest rate or yield</p>

    <p> <b> WORLD HISTORY </b>

    <br>
    <p> A peasant is a pre-industrial agricultural laborer or a farmer with limited land-ownership, especially one
        living in the Middle Ages under feudalism and paying rent, tax, fees, or services to a landlord.[1][2] In
        Europe, three classes of peasants existed: non-free slaves, semi-free serfs, and free tenants. Peasants might
        hold title to land outright (fee simple), or by any of several forms of land tenure, among them socage,
        quit-rent, leasehold, and copyhold.[3]

        In some contexts, "peasant" has a pejorative meaning, even when referring to farm laborers.[4] As early as in
        13th-century Germany, the concept of "peasant" could imply "rustic" as well as "robber", as the English term
        villain[5]/villein.[6][7] In 21st-century English, the word "peasant" can mean "an ignorant, rude, or
        unsophisticated person".[8] The word rose to renewed popularity in the 1940s–1960s[9] as a collective term,
        often referring to rural populations of developing countries in general, as the "semantic successor to 'native',
        incorporating all its condescending and racial overtones".[4]

        The word peasantry is commonly used in a non-pejorative sense as a collective noun for the rural population in
        the poor and developing countries of the world.[citation needed] Via Campesina, an organization claiming to
        represent the rights of about 200 million farm-workers around the world, self-defines as an "International
        Peasant's Movement" as of 2019.[10] The United Nations and its Human Rights Council prominently uses the term
        "peasant" in a non-pejorative sense, as in the UN Declaration on the Rights of Peasants and Other People Working
        in Rural Areas adopted in 2018. In general English-language literature, the use of the word "peasant" has
        steadily declined since about 1970. The word "peasant" is derived from the 15th-century French word païsant,
        meaning one from the pays, or countryside; ultimately from the Latin pagus, or outlying administrative district.
        Social position

        Finnish Savonian farmers at a cottage in early 19th century; by Pehr Hilleström and J. F. Martin
        Peasants typically made up the majority of the agricultural labour force in a pre-industrial society. The
        majority of the people—according to one estimate 85% of the population—in the Middle Ages were peasants.[13]

        Though "peasant" is a word of loose application, once a market economy had taken root, the term peasant
        proprietors was frequently used to describe the traditional rural population in countries where smallholders
        farmed much of the land. More generally, the word "peasant" is sometimes used to refer pejoratively to those
        considered to be "lower class", perhaps defined by poorer education and/or a lower income. </p>
    <br>
    <p> If you enjoy reading tales set in the Middle Ages, you’ve probably encountered your fair share of knights,
        dragons, and peasants, or residents of the countryside.

        During the Middle Ages in Europe, most members of the population were peasants who lived a meager existence,
        working farmland that was owned by wealthy noblemen. Peasant is still used sometimes today to describe a
        relatively poor person who works as a farm laborer. Peasant can also be used to mean “an unsophisticated and
        ill-mannered person,” so when using this word, be sure your intended meaning is clear. </p>

    <p> If something has to do with money, it's pecuniary. If your grandfather's antique watch has pecuniary value, it's
        worth money — you could sell it for cash if you weren't sentimentally attached to keeping it.

        Pecuniary might seem like a peculiar word for talking about money, but it all adds up when you learn that it was
        the worth of the cattle, or pecū in Latin, that gave pecuniary its meaning. In Roman times, livestock served as
        money in making transactions. Some cultures still have economies based on cattle, but most modern societies have
        a pecuniary system based on, well, money. </p>

        donated by people who are able to give. Many charities, museums, universities, cultural centers, and scientific
        institutions rely on philanthropic support to pay their bills. </p>

        governments or military groups persecute, or punish, people for religious beliefs, often sending them to prisons
        or work camps.

        You can use the verb persecute to talk about abusive acts against a person or group of people. Persecute is
        usually used to specify the harm done to a particular group, as when a person is persecuted for his affiliation
        with a religious group. Those born of a certain race or culture can be targets too. Adolf Hitler became
        notorious for his orders to persecute the Jewish people. </p>

    <br>
    <p> Persecution is the systematic mistreatment of an individual or group by another individual or group. The most
        common forms are religious persecution, racism, and political persecution, though there is naturally some
        overlap between these terms. The inflicting of suffering, harassment, imprisonment, internment, fear or pain are
        all factors that may establish persecution, but not all suffering will necessarily establish persecution. The
        threshold of severity has been a source of much debate. </p>
    <br>
    <p> Persecution is unfair or abusive treatment toward a person or group of people, such as the persecution of
        someone who is different by calling him or her rude names and making threats.

        The noun persecution is related to persecute, which comes from Latin persecut-, meaning “followed with
        hostility.” Persecution means hassling or singling out a person or group because of race, religion, ethnicity,
        sexual orientation, gender, or social status. In many schools, the persecution of students by bullies has
        resulted in a zero-tolerance policy for such despicable behavior. </p>

    <blockquote>What Is Employee Retention?
        Employee retention is a phenomenon where employees choose to stay on with their current company
        and don’t actively seek other job prospects. The opposite of retention is turnover, where employees
        leave the company for a variety of reasons.
        Retention is defined as the process by which a company ensures that its employees don’t quit their jobs.
        Every company and industry has a varying retention rate, which indicates the percentage of employees
        who remained with the organization during a fixed period.</blockquote>

        Contract law: In the law of contracts, revocation is a type of remedy for buyers when the
        buyer accepts a nonconforming good from the seller.[1] Upon receiving the nonconforming good, the
        buyer may choose to accept it despite the nonconformity, reject it (although this may not be allowed
        under the perfect tender rule and whether the Seller still has time to cure), or revoke their acceptance.
        Under Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code, for a buyer to revoke, he must show (1) the goods
        failed to conform to the contract and (2) it substantially impaired the value of the goods (this is
        a question of fact). A Proposal/Offer May be revoked at any time, before the communication of its
        acceptance is complete as against the proposer, but not afterwards.
        If the buyer knew of the nonconformity at the time of acceptance, he can revoke only if he can show he
        accepted the goods with the impression the seller would cure it and that did not happen. If he
        did not know of the nonconformity at acceptance, he can revoke only if he can prove he
        was reasonably induced by the difficulty of discovering the defect or by the seller's assurances. The
        buyer can revoke if (1) it occurs within a reasonable time after the buyer discovers or should have
        discovered; (2) before any substantial change in the goods not caused by their own defects; and (3) not
        effective until the buyer notifies the seller he is going to revoke. Upon revocation, the buyer can then
        cancel the contract and compel refund of the purchase price of the goods. In some states, the courts
        allow the seller to set off the price for the time the buyer kept the goods before the revocation.
        In contract law, revocation can also refer to the termination of an offer.[2] An offeror may revoke an
        offer before it has been accepted, but the revocation must be communicated to the offeree, although
        not necessarily by the offeror. If the offer was made to the entire world, such as in Carlill v Carbolic
        Smoke Ball Co, the revocation must take a form that is similar to the offer. However, an offer may not be
        revoked if it has been encapsulated in an option.
        If the offer is one that leads to a unilateral contract, then unless there was an ancillary contract entered
        into that guaranteed that the main contract would not be withdrawn, the contract may be revoked at

        Government administration: There are many forms of revocation, which are typically done as either a
        punishment, or to prevent abuse of a privilege. When the revocation is temporary, it is called a
        suspension, as in a "suspended driver's license".
        In criminal law, revocation of probation in the criminal justice system occurs when the subject violates
        the terms of probation and is incarcerated. (Release upon successful completion of the probationary
        term is not called revocation.)[3]
        Revocation of legal rights, privileges, or license can occur either administratively or through criminal
        courts. A common example is the revocation of a driver's license for egregious or repeated violations
        of traffic laws, which can be done by a criminal court, or an administrative traffic court, depending on
        jurisdiction.[4] Another example is the loss of certain privileges in government environments that permit
        restrictions on normal citizen rights:
        Revocation of privileges in military service, such as a liberty pass;[5]
        Revocation of privileges prison inmates, such as visitation rights.[6]
        A related type of revocation occurs when a person loses some form of rank or office. The demotion or
        removal is sometimes termed revocation.[citation needed]. Finally, a person can revoke a grant of
        representation. For example, a person may sign a power of
        attorney, then later revoke it. The previous grantee then loses the right make decisions on the
        principal's (grantor's) behalf.[7]
        Canon law: In canon law, grants, laws, contracts, sentences, jurisdiction, and appointments are at times
        revoked by the grantor, his successor or superior according to the prescriptions of law. Revocation
        without just cause is illicit though often valid. Laws and customs are revoked when, owing to change of
        circumstances, they cease to be just and reasonable.
        Concordats are revocable when they redound to the serious injury of the Catholic Church. not officially
        recognized or controlled. Institutionalised: officially placed in or committed to a specialized institution.

    <p> <b> STATISTICS </b>
        a measure of the relation between the mean value of one variable (e.g. output) and corresponding values of other
        variables (e.g. time and cost). What Is a Regression?
        Regression is a statistical method used in finance, investing, and other disciplines that attempts to determine
        the strength and character of the relationship between one dependent variable (usually denoted by Y) and a
        series of other variables (known as independent variables).

        Also called simple regression or ordinary least squares (OLS), linear regression is the most common form of this
        technique. Linear regression establishes the linear relationship between two variables based on a line of best
        fit. Linear regression is thus graphically depicted using a straight line with the slope defining how the change
        in one variable impacts a change in the other. The y-intercept of a linear regression relationship represents
        the value of one variable when the value of the other is zero. Non-linear regression models also exist, but are
        far more complex.

        Regression analysis is a powerful tool for uncovering the associations between variables observed in data, but
        cannot easily indicate causation. It is used in several contexts in business, finance, and economics. For
        instance, it is used to help investment managers value assets and understand the relationships between factors
        such as commodity prices and the stocks of businesses dealing in those commodities.

        Regression as a statistical technique should not be confused with the concept of regression to the mean (mean
        reversion). <br> <b> KEY TAKEAWAYS </b>
        A regression is a statistical technique that relates a dependent variable to one or more independent
        (explanatory) variables.
        A regression model is able to show whether changes observed in the dependent variable are associated with
        changes in one or more of the explanatory variables.
        It does this by essentially fitting a best-fit line and seeing how the data is dispersed around this line.
        Regression helps economists and financial analysts in things ranging from asset valuation to making predictions.
        In order for regression results to be properly interpreted, several assumptions about the data and the model
        itself must hold. Understanding Regression
        Regression captures the correlation between variables observed in a data set and quantifies whether those
        correlations are statistically significant or not.

        The two basic types of regression are simple linear regression and multiple linear regression, although there
        are non-linear regression methods for more complicated data and analysis. Simple linear regression uses one
        independent variable to explain or predict the outcome of the dependent variable Y, while multiple linear
        regression uses two or more independent variables to predict the outcome (while holding all others constant).

        Regression can help finance and investment professionals as well as professionals in other businesses.
        Regression can also help predict sales for a company based on weather, previous sales, GDP growth, or other
        types of conditions. The capital asset pricing model (CAPM) is an often-used regression model in finance for
        pricing assets and discovering the costs of capital.

        Regression and Econometrics
        Econometrics is a set of statistical techniques used to analyze data in finance and economics. An example of the
        application of econometrics is to study the income effect using observable data. An economist may, for example,
        hypothesize that as a person increases their income their spending will also increase.

        If the data show that such an association is present, a regression analysis can then be conducted to understand
        the strength of the relationship between income and consumption and whether or not that relationship is
        statistically significant—that is, it appears to be unlikely that it is due to chance alone.

        Note that you can have several explanatory variables in your analysis—for example, changes to GDP and inflation
        in addition to unemployment in explaining stock market prices. When more than one explanatory variable is used,
        it is referred to as multiple linear regression. This is the most commonly used tool in econometrics.

        Econometrics is sometimes criticized for relying too heavily on the interpretation of regression output without
        linking it to economic theory or looking for causal mechanisms. It is crucial that the findings revealed in the
        data are able to be adequately explained by a theory, even if that means developing your own theory of the
        underlying processes. Calculating Regression
        Linear regression models often use a least-squares approach to determine the line of best fit. The least-squares
        technique is determined by minimizing the sum of squares created by a mathematical function. A square is, in
        turn, determined by squaring the distance between a data point and the regression line or mean value of the data
        set. Example of How Regression Analysis Is Used in Finance
        Regression is often used to determine how many specific factors such as the price of a commodity, interest
        rates, particular industries, or sectors influence the price movement of an asset. The aforementioned CAPM is
        based on regression, and it is utilized to project the expected returns for stocks and to generate costs of
        capital. A stock's returns are regressed against the returns of a broader index, such as the S&P 500, to
        generate a beta for the particular stock.

        Beta is the stock's risk in relation to the market or index and is reflected as the slope in the CAPM model. The
        return for the stock in question would be the dependent variable Y, while the independent variable X would be
        the market risk premium.

        Additional variables such as the market capitalization of a stock, valuation ratios, and recent returns can be
        added to the CAPM model to get better estimates for returns. These additional factors are known as the
        Fama-French factors, named after the professors who developed the multiple linear regression model to better
        explain asset returns.1

        Why Is It Called Regression?
        Although there is some debate about the origins of the name, the statistical technique described above most
        likely was termed "regression" by Sir Francis Galton in the 19th century to describe the statistical feature of
        biological data (such as heights of people in a population) to regress to some mean level. In other words, while
        there are shorter and taller people, only outliers are very tall or short, and most people cluster somewhere
        around (or "regress" to) the average.2

        What Is the Purpose of Regression?
        In statistical analysis, regression is used to identify the associations between variables occurring in some
        data. It can show both the magnitude of such an association and also determine its statistical significance
        (i.e., whether or not the association is likely due to chance). Regression is a powerful tool for statistical
        inference and has also been used to try to predict future outcomes based on past observations.

        How Do You Interpret a Regression Model?
        A regression model output may be in the form of Y = 1.0 + (3.2)X1 - 2.0(X2) + 0.21.

        Here we have a multiple linear regression that relates some variable Y with two explanatory variables X1 and X2.
        We would interpret the model as the value of Y changes by 3.2x for every one-unit change in X1 (if X1 goes up by
        2, Y goes up by 6.4, etc.) holding all else constant (all else equal). That means controlling for X2, X1 has
        this observed relationship. Likewise, holding X1 constant, every one unit increase in X2 is associated with a 2x
        decrease in Y. We can also note the y-intercept of 1.0, meaning that Y = 1 when X1 and X2 are both zero. The
        error term (residual) is 0.21.

        What Are the Assumptions That Must Hold for Regression Models?
        In order to properly interpret the output of a regression model, the following main assumptions about the
        underlying data process of what you analyzing must hold:

        The relationship between variables is linear
        Homoskedasticity, or that the variance of the variables and error term must remain constant
        All explanatory variables are independent of one another
        All variables are normally-distributed </p>
    <br>
    <p> Regression is defined as a statistical method that helps us to analyze and understand the relationship between
        two or more variables of interest. The process that is adapted to perform regression analysis helps to
        understand which factors are important, which factors can be ignored, and how they are influencing each other.

        In regression, we normally have one dependent variable and one or more independent variables. Here we try to
        “regress” the value of the dependent variable “Y” with the help of the independent variables. In other words, we
        are trying to understand, how the value of ‘Y’ changes w.r.t change in ‘X’.

        For the regression analysis is be a successful method, we understand the following terms:

        Dependent Variable: This is the variable that we are trying to understand or forecast.
        Independent Variable: These are factors that influence the analysis or target variable and provide us with
        information regarding the relationship of the variables with the target variable. What is Regression Analysis?
        Regression analysis is used for prediction and forecasting. This has substantial overlap with the field of
        machine learning. This statistical method is used across different industries such as,

        Financial Industry- Understand the trend in the stock prices, forecast the prices, and evaluate risks in the
        insurance domain
        Marketing- Understand the effectiveness of market campaigns, and forecast pricing and sales of the product.
        Manufacturing- Evaluate the relationship of variables that determine to define a better engine to provide better
        performance
        Medicine- Forecast the different combinations of medicines to prepare generic medicines for diseases. </p>

        Sometimes resentment lasts for years. It can be strong and hard to pull out, like an old, gnarled tree root.
        While resentment over being wronged can come from just one act against you, it also can get stronger over time,
        as in "your growing resentment might just come from the fact that the team captain always picks you last." It
        also comes from misunderstandings, like feeling resentment over a dirty look you thought was directed at you but
        really wasn't. It's usually best to root out resentment early. </p>
    <br>
    <p> Resentment (also called ranklement or bitterness) is a complex, multilayered emotion[1] that has been described
        as a mixture of disappointment, disgust and anger.[2] Other psychologists consider it a mood[3] or as a
        secondary emotion (including cognitive elements) that can be elicited in the face of insult or injury.[4]

        Inherent in resentment is a perception of unfairness (i.e. from trivial to very serious), and a generalized
        defense against unfair situations (e.g. relationships or unfavourable circumstances).[3]

        The word originates from French "ressentir", re-, intensive prefix, and sentir "to feel"; from the Latin
        "sentire". The English word has become synonymous with anger, spite, and holding a grudge. Resentment can result
        from a variety of situations involving a perceived wrongdoing from an individual, which are often sparked by
        expressions of injustice or humiliation. Common sources of resentment include publicly humiliating incidents
        such as accepting negative treatment without voicing any protest; feeling like an object of regular
        discrimination or prejudice; envy/jealousy; feeling used or taken advantage of by others; and having
        achievements go unrecognized, while others succeed without working as hard. Resentment can also be generated by
        dyadic interactions, such as emotional rejection or denial by another person, deliberate embarrassment or
        belittling by another person, or ignorance, putting down, or scorn by another person.[5]

        Resentment can also develop, and be maintained by: focusing on past grievances (i.e. disturbing memories of
        hurtful experiences) continuously,[3] or by trying to justify the emotion (i.e. with additional
        thoughts/feelings).[6][7] Thus, resentment can occur as a result of the grief process[8] and can be sustained by
        ruminating. Alice MacLachlan writes "What we resent reveals what it is we value, and what we have come to expect
        (or hope) from others; it may also reveal to what we see ourselves as entitled {to}: that is, how our
        expectations of our surroundings are organized and measured.[10]" Indeed, she goes on to further write that only
        an amoral person (a person who didn't have values or concern for the well-being of self or others) could not
        experience resentment.[10]

        Resentment can also function to warn against further, future, harmful and unfair situations from occurring again
        (its focus is on the future).[3] Resentment, used as a form of distrust, has a strong component of
        self-punishment:[3] "the false appeal of self-punishment is that it seems to keep us safe from future hurt and
        disappointment", when in reality it is hurting the resenter more (i.e. how we mistreat or distrust others
        unrelated to the offense, ourselves, etc.).

        Resentment has also been conceptualized as a form of protest: "More specifically, resentment protests a past
        action, that persists as a present threat".[11] The 'present threat' being that the past harmful action(s),
        makes a claim: that you can be treated this way, or that such treatment is acceptable; It poses a threat, and in
        resenting it, you challenge that claim (i.e. protest). "Resentment affirms what the {offenders'} act denies"-
        its harmfulness and the victim's worth.[11] It is worth noting that Pamela Hieronymi claims the object of
        protest is the past event, rather than the offender of the event: claiming that resentment need not develop into
        malice or a desire for retribution (if resentment is focused on the past harmful situation or event, rather than
        the person who caused it).[11]

        Resentment, when it is unhealthy, can come in the form of: hostile anger with a retaliation motive (i.e.
        fantasizing about putting someone down, devaluing, or paying someone back for a perceived injury),[3] time
        duration (which can go on for days, weeks, or even years),[3] or when too many resentments are held;[9] Thus,
        draining resources, creating stress, and draining positive emotions. Unlike many emotions, resentment does not
        have physical tags exclusively related to it that telegraph when a person is feeling this emotion. However,
        physical expressions associated with related emotions such as anger and envy may be exhibited, such as furrowed
        brows or bared teeth.[13]

        Resentment can be self-diagnosed by looking for signs such as the need for emotion regulation, faking happiness
        while with a person to cover true feelings toward them, or speaking in a sarcastic or demeaning way to or about
        the person. It can also be diagnosed through the appearance of agitation- or dejection-related emotions, such as
        feeling inexplicably depressed or despondent, becoming angry for no apparent reason, or having nightmares or
        disturbing daydreams about a person. Resentment is most powerful when it is felt toward someone whom the
        individual is close to or intimate with. To have an injury resulting in resentful feelings inflicted by a friend
        or loved one leaves the individual feeling betrayed as well as resentful, and these feelings can have deep
        effects.[15]

        Resentment can have a variety of negative results on the person experiencing it, including touchiness or
        edginess when thinking of the person resented, denial of anger or hatred against this person, and provocation or
        anger arousal when this person is recognized positively. It can also have more long-term effects, such as the
        development of a hostile, cynical, sarcastic attitude that may become a barrier against other healthy
        relationships; lack of personal and emotional growth; difficulty in self-disclosure; trouble trusting others;
        loss of self-confidence; and overcompensation.[5]

        Chronic resentment (i.e. for a prolonged period of time) can also lead to unhealthy symptoms, such as the
        constriction of nerve endings in your muscles (causing chronic, low-grade muscle and back-pain).[3] Such
        long-lasting resentment can also cause destruction of T cells (lowering the immune system), hypertension (which
        increases the threat of stroke and heart attack), cancer, (drug) addictions, depression, and shortened life
        span. Coping
        To further compound these negative effects, resentment often functions in a downward spiral. Resentful feelings
        cut off communication between the resentful person and the person he or she feels committed the wrong, and can
        result in future miscommunications and the development of further resentful feelings.[16] Because of the
        consequences they carry, resentful feelings are dangerous to live with and need to be dealt with. Resentment is
        an obstacle to the restoration of equal moral relations among persons.[15]

        Resentment and spite also share a connection of self-harm, yet differ primarily in the way they are expressed.
        Resentment is unique in that it is almost exclusively internalized, where it can do further emotional and
        psychological damage but does not strongly impact the person resented. By contrast, spite is exclusively
        externalized, involving vindictive actions against a (perceived or actual) source of wrong. Spiteful actions can
        stem from resentful feelings, however.

        Psychologist James J. Messina recommends five steps to facing and resolving resentful feelings: (1) Identify the
        source of the resentful feelings and what it is the person did to evoke these feelings; (2) develop a new way of
        looking at past, present and future life, including how resentment has affected life and how letting go of
        resentment can improve the future; (3) write a letter to the source of the resentment, listing offenses and
        explaining the circumstances, then forgive and let go of the offenses (but do not send the letter); (4)
        visualize a future without the negative impact of resentment; and (5) if resentful feelings still linger, return
        to Step 1 and begin again.[5]

        Post-traumatic embitterment disorder has been linked to resentment, in some cases.

        Comparison with anger
        Robert C. Solomon, a professor of philosophy at the University of Texas at Austin, places resentment on the same
        continuum as anger and contempt, and he argues that the differences between the three are that resentment is
        anger directed toward a higher-status individual; anger is directed toward an equal-status individual; and
        contempt is anger directed toward a lower-status individual.[17]

        Steven Stosny makes an analogy, distinguishing the functions of anger and resentment, as: anger being a
        fire-extinguisher meant to 'put-out' and prevent immediately harmful situations, from becoming more harmful,
        while resentment is more like a smoke-alarm: something that is always 'on' (and requires energy and emotions to
        sustain this alarm-system), and is meant to protect us if, just in case, someone or something harmful from past
        experience shows up.[3] Resentment and anger differ primarily in the way they are externally expressed. Anger
        results in aggressive behavior, used to avert or deal with a threat,[18] while resentment occurs once the injury
        has been dealt and is not expressed as aggressively or as openly.

        Another differentiation between anger and resentment, is as follows: anger is about the immediate situation (to
        back off or submit), whereas resentment is a defensive way to mentally punish (or in the more extreme case, to
        devalue) yourself, or the remembered offender.[3] Another differentiation is that resentment is rarely (if ever)
        about a single specific stimulus:[3] even after behavioural changes have been made (i.e. accountability has been
        addressed) or the stimulus is no longer present (i.e. situation is no longer encountered) resentment can still
        be present. Whereas anger is triggered by a specific stimulus, and usually reduces in intensity as the stimulus
        attenuates (or is no longer present).

        Comparison with conviction
        An important feature of acting on resentment is that it is against something (i.e. unfairness, injustice, abuse,
        situations that threaten values or well-being). Whereas, acting on conviction is for something (i.e. justice,
        well-being of self or others, or any other values held by an individual as important). The distinction is
        important, when acted upon, because while acting for one's deeper values creates actions consistent with one's
        values, acting against things (or people) one does not value does not necessarily lead to actions that are
        consistent with one's deeper values (i.e. retribution, murder).[3] Self-reflection can help determine which of
        the two that one is acting on, by stating why the behavior is consistent with one's deeper values: if one's
        answer represents conviction, it will reflect one's deeper values; if it is resentful it will devalue someone or
        something.[3]

        Philosophical perspectives
        Max Scheler considered resentment as the product of weakness and passivity.[19]
        Nietzsche saw resentment as an ignoble emotion underlying Rousseau-esque Romanticism - "for under all
        romanticism lie the grunting and greed of Rousseau's instinct for revenge".[20]
        Philosopher Robert C. Solomon wrote extensively on the emotion of resentment and its negative effects on those
        who experience it. Solomon describes resentment as the means by which man clings to his self-respect. He wrote
        that it is in this moment when humanity is at its lowest ebb.[citation needed]
        Scheler was instrumental in Ressentiment thought.

        Alcoholism and bigotry
        Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) cites resentment as the number one offender, and one of the greatest threats to an
        alcoholic.[21] The Twelve Steps of AA involve identifying and dealing with resentment as part of the path toward
        recovery, including acknowledging one's own role in resentment and praying for the resentment to be taken away.
        The inventory that AA suggests for processing resentments is to first inventory the resentment by identifying
        what person, institution, or principle one is angry at, then to identify why one is angry, what instincts of
        self are affected by the resentment. Finally, disregarding the other person involved entirely, the alcoholic
        looks for their own mistakes, where they are to blame and where they have been at fault: where has the alcoholic
        been selfish, self-seeking, dishonest, or frightened?[21] After writing and sharing an inventory, unselfish,
        constructive action is taken.

        Resentment can also play a role in racial and ethnic conflicts. Resentment is cited as having infected the
        structure of social value, and is thus a regular catalyst in conflicts sparked by inequality.[22] It can also be
        one of the emotions experienced during class conflict, particularly by the oppressed social class.

        Literary examples
        The writer Norman Douglas confessed to a habit of borrowing money, like D. H. Lawrence; but unlike Lawrence,
        Douglas was able to hide "the primary reaction: resentfulness…. We object to being patronized; it makes us
        resentful".[23]
        Sociologist Zygmunt Bauman discusses resentment: "Both Nietzsche and Scheler point to ressentiment as a major
        obstacle to loving the Other as thyself. (While they wrote in German, they used the French term ressentiment,
        the complex meaning of which is less than perfectly conveyed by the more straightforward English term
        "resentment").</p>

         The word salvation comes from the Latin salvare, "to save." Each of the monotheistic religions
        has a different idea about the way to achieve salvation. Salvation doesn't always have to do with
        theology; if a freak snowstorm on your camping trip has you worried about hypothermia,
        salvation can come in the form of an abandoned house with a working fireplace.
         https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvation </p>
    <p> Salvation (from Latin: salvatio, from salva, 'safe, saved') is the state of being saved or protected
        from harm or a dire situation.[1] In religion and theology, salvation generally refers to the
        deliverance of the soul from sin and its consequences.[2][3] The academic study of salvation is
        called soteriology.
         Meaning[edit]
         See also: Redemption (theology)
         In Abrahamic religions and theology, salvation is the saving of the soul from sin and its
        consequences.[2] It may also be called deliverance or redemption from sin and its
        effects.[4] Depending on the religion or even denomination, salvation is considered to be caused
        either only by the grace of God (i.e. unmerited and unearned), or by faith, good deeds (works),
        or a combination thereof. Religions often emphasize that man is a sinner by nature and that the
        penalty of sin is death (physical death, spiritual death: spiritual separation from God and eternal
        punishment in hell).</p>
    <p> Salvation is an opposite of the quranic verse: Chapter Fatir or Al-Mala’ikah (The originator of
        creation, or the angels). Verse/Ayah: 18</p>

    <strong>And no bearer of burdens shall bear another's burden, and if one heavily laden calls another to (bear)
        his load, nothing of it will be lifted even though he be near of kin. You (O Muhammad SAW) can warn
        only those who fear their Lord unseen, and perform As-Salat (IqamatasSalat). And he who purifies
        himself (from all kinds of sins), then he purifies only for the benefit of his ownself. And to Allah is the
        (final) Return (of all).</strong>

    <blockquote>Abdullah Yusuf Ali - Translation</blockquote>
    <strong>Nor can a bearer of burdens bear another's burdens if one heavily laden should call another to (bear) his
        load. Not the least portion of it can be carried (by the other). Even though he be nearly related. Thou
        canst but admonish such as fear their Lord unseen and establish regular Prayer. And whoever purifies
        himself does so for the benefit of his own soul, and the destination (of all) is to Allah.</strong></p>

    <p>Skepticism: doubt as to the truth of something. PHILOSOPHY: the theory that certain knowledge is
        impossible. An attitude that shows you doubt whether something is true or useful: skepticism, also
        spelled scepticism, in Western philosophy, the attitude of doubting knowledge claims set forth in
        various areas. Skeptics have challenged the adequacy or reliability of these claims by asking what
        principles they are based upon or what they actually establish. They have questioned whether some
        such claims really are, as alleged, indubitable or necessarily true, and they have challenged the
        purported rational grounds of accepted assumptions. In everyday life, practically everyone is skeptical
        about some knowledge claims; but philosophical skeptics have doubted the possibility of any knowledge
        beyond that of the contents of directly felt experience. The original Greek meaning of skeptikos was “an
        inquirer,” someone who was unsatisfied and still looking for truth.
        an attitude of doubt or a disposition to incredulity either in general or toward a particular object. The
        doctrine that true knowledge or knowledge in a particular area is uncertain. the method of suspended

    <p>Supersensory: Beyond the reach of the senses; above the natural powers of perception. Beyond the

        Transcending the bounds of normal sensation. Supersensory (not comparable) beyond the range of
        what is perceptible by the senses; not belonging to the experience able physical world. Heaven is a
        supersensory realm. Supernatural. Independent of the organs of sense. Beyond the range of what
        is perceptible by the senses; not belonging to the experience able physical world. Supersensory is
        something which you can’t feel, can’t touch, can’t see, can’t smell, can’t hear, but can be judge by sixth
        sense. And you believe that it exists. For example the people 100 years ago can’t think about internet or
        cellphones or personal computer but today it exist. People 200 years about can’t think about cars or
        traveling in the air but today it is possible. People 150 years ago can’t imagine that one day a person
        walk over the moon. So in the same sense even though some hidden thinks are not in front of our eyes
        or our inherited senses. But basic human instinct is telling us that it exists for example ghost, spirits,
        demons, angels and devils, Satan etc. Mental, metaphysical, psychological, spiritual etc. Koi aisi cheez Jo

        pertains to the significance of living or existence in general. Many
        other related questions include: "Why are we here?", "What is life all about?", or "What is the purpose
        of existence?" There have been many proposed answers to these questions from many
        different cultural and ideological backgrounds. The search for life's meaning has produced
        much philosophical, scientific, theological, and metaphysical speculation throughout history. Different
        people and cultures believe different things about the answer to this question.
        The meaning of life can be derived from philosophical and religious contemplation of, and scientific
        inquiries about, existence, social ties, consciousness, and happiness. Many other issues are also involved, such
        as symbolic meaning, ontology, value, purpose, ethics, good and evil, free will,
        the existence of one or multiple gods, conceptions of God, the soul, and the afterlife. Scientific
        contributions focus primarily on describing related empirical facts about the universe, exploring the
        context and parameters concerning the "how" of life. Science also studies and can provide
        recommendations for the pursuit of well-being and a related conception of morality. An
        alternative, humanistic approach poses the question, "What is the meaning of my life?"</p>

    <p> Summon / Summoned: order (someone) to be present. Authoritatively call on (someone) to be present as

        to order someone to come to or be present at a particular place, or

        Having been called on, called forward, or ordered to come, especially for a specific purpose or to a
        specific place, such as a court of law:
        Dictionary.com having been called forth by magic, as from a supernatural or demoniac realm:
        A summons (also known in England and Wales as a claim form and in the Australian state of New South
        Wales as a court attendance notice (CAN)) is a legal document issued by a court (a judicial summons) or
        by an administrative agency of government (an administrative summons) for various purposes.
        1) Judicial summons: A judicial summons is served on a person involved in a legal proceeding. Legal
        action may be in progress against the person, or the person's presence as witness may be
        required.[1] In the former case, the summons will typically announce to the person to whom it is
        directed that a legal proceeding has been started against that person, and that a case has been
        initiated in the issuing court. In some jurisdictions, it may be drafted in legal English difficult for
        the layman to understand, while several U.S. states expressly require summonses to be drafted
        in plain English and that they must start with this phrase: "Notice! You have been sued."
        The summons announces a date by which the person or persons summoned must either appear in
        court, or respond in writing to the court or the opposing party or parties. The summons is the
        descendant of the writ of the common law. It replaces the former procedure in common-law countries
        by which the plaintiff actually had to ask the sheriff to arrest the defendant in order for the court to
        obtain personal jurisdiction in both criminal and civil actions.
        2) Citation/claim (legal term)
        A citation, traffic violation ticket, or notice to appear is a type of summons prepared and served at the
        scene of the occurrence by a law enforcement official, compelling the appearance of a defendant before
        the local magistrate within a certain period of time to answer for a minor traffic
        infraction, misdemeanor, or other summary offence. Failure to appear within the allotted period of time
        is a separate crime of failure to appear.
        3) Civil summons
        A civil summons is most often accompanied by a complaint. Depending on the type of summons, there is
        often an option to endorse a summons so that the entity being served may be identified. In the court
        system in California, for civil unlimited cases in the superior court, a summons will often have these
        options to endorse:
        as an individual;
        as the person sued under the fictitious name of ;
        on behalf of (usually for a company); or
        by personal delivery on _
        4) Administrative summons One example of an administrative summons is found in the tax law of the United States.
        The Internal
        Revenue Code authorizes the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to issue a summons for a taxpayer—or
        any person having custody of books of account relating to a business of a taxpayer—to appear before
        the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate (generally, this means the IRS employee who issued
        the summons) at the time and place named in the summons.[2] The person summoned may be required
        to produce books, papers, records, or other data, and to give testimony under oath before an IRS
        employee.
        5) Summonses by jurisdictions of different countries or states or authorities.
        A summons is a form prepared by the plaintiff and issued by a court that informs the defendant that
        they are being sued or are required to appear in court. It may be served by a sheriff or other authorized
        person, such as the process server.
        In the context of civil cases, this case from Nebraska, explains that “a summons is an instrument used to
        provide notice to a party of civil proceedings and of the opportunity to appear and be heard.” A
        summons informs the defendant that they have a certain number of days to respond to the lawsuit or
        appear in the court.
        In the context of criminal cases, a summons can be served on a defendant facing minor criminal charges
        and used as an alternative to an arrest warrant. This case from Missouri, explains that “a ‘summons’ is
        more or less a notice or an invitation to a defendant to come to court at a certain time and answer to a
        certain charge so that he may not be subjected to inconvenience and embarrassment of an arrest.”</p>
    <br>
    <p>Summoned Definition- The term “summoned” is typically defined as the action of officially calling,
        requesting, or demanding someone to appear, attend, or perform a specific task or duty. It involves
        issuing a summons or a formal notification to notify the individual of their required presence or action.

    <p>Sophistry: (Sufi-ism walay. Sufiya/Sofia) [countable] a reason or an explanation that tries to show that
        something is true when it is really false [uncountable] the use of clever arguments to persuade people
        that something is true when it is really false. 1. a subtle, tricky, superficially plausible,
        but generally fallacious method of reasoning.
        2. a false argument; sophism
        1. unsound or misleading but clever, plausible, and subtle argument or reasoning; sophism
        2. the methods or practices of the Sophists
        a. a method of argument that is seemingly plausible though actually invalid and misleading
        b. the art of using such arguments
        2. subtle but unsound or fallacious reasoning
        3. an instance of this; sophism
        Sophistry is the practice of using clever arguments that sound convincing but are in fact false. the use of
        clever but false arguments, especially with the intention of deceiving. a fallacious argument based on
        Spinglish. subtly deceptive reasoning or argumentation. the clever use of arguments that seem true but
        are really false, in order to deceive people. a subtle, tricky, superficially plausible, but generally
        fallacious method of reasoning. a false argument; sophism.
        Sophistry is tricking someone by making a seemingly clever argument, like a philosopher who argues
        that up is down and somehow convinces you. If you accuse someone of sophistry, you mean they’ll lie to
        make a point.
        The word sophistry has roots in ancient Greece. The Sophists were teachers who were celebrated in
        their time but were later thought to be more like con artists who would say anything to win an
        argument. Sophistry is like spin — it means twisting the truth to bend to one’s needs. Politician might
        accuse people who disagree with them of using sophistry. a deliberately invalid argument displaying
        ingenuity in reasoning in the hope of deceiving someone. Synonyms: sophism, sophistication
        type of: fallacy, false belief.
        Reasoning that appears sound but is misleading or fallacious is known as sophistry.
        In Metaphysics, Aristotle defines sophistry as "wisdom in appearance only."
        From the Greek, "clever, wise."
        Examples and Observations
        "Sophisms are intended paralogisms, meant to deceive. The term, which derives from the Greek word
        for wisdom, sophia, acquired its pejorative meaning from Socrates, who denounced the hypocrisy of the
        sages (or Sophists)—logicians who, he claimed, were both mercenary and pretentious. The truly wise
        know that wisdom, like truth, is an ideal to be sought constantly; they are therefore friends of wisdom
        (philo-sophers)."
        (Bernard Dupriez, A Dictionary of Literary Devices. Trans. by Albert W. Halsall. Univ. of Toronto Press,
        1991)
        Sophistry, Rhetoric, Logic, and Philosophy: "There is in sophistry a similarity to precisely what some
        praise as the value of symbolic logic: in knowing logic a person in principle knows everything, because
        there is nothing that can't be argued in it. Plato has the Visitor in the Sophist make the same
        observation: 'In fact, take expertise in disputation as a whole. Doesn't it seem like a capacity that's
        sufficient for carrying on controversies about absolutely everything?'... The difference between
        philosophy and sophistry on this point could perhaps be summed up by saying that, while sophistry
        represents an abstract universality, philosophy's universality is essentially concrete. Sophistry is
        indifferent to content, and this indifference prevents it from integrating what it knows into a wellordered
        and meaningful whole... Sophistry can 'know' this or that, but it cannot see how these things hang together or
        how they fit into the cosmos, because to do so would require genuine knowledge of
        the good."
        (D. C. Schindler, Plato's Critique of Impure Reason: On Goodness and Truth in the Republic. Catholic
        Univ. of America Press, 2008)
        "With respect to the famous sophists of ancient Greece, the habit for over 2,000 years has been to
        follow Plato's suggestion that sophistry and rhetoric are inextricably 'mixed together' (Gorgias 465C4-5).
        When the sophists engaged in intellectual pursuits that we might be tempted to call philosophical, it was
        only with an eye toward captivating their audiences and hence capturing more students. In short, it was
        not 'real' philosophy at all but either a cheap knock-off designed to fool the unsuspecting or,
        occasionally, simply an accidental byproduct of rhetorical pursuits."

        Pragmatism, ed. by Steven Mailloux. Cambridge University Press, 1995)
        Metaphors for Sophistry: "Sophistry, like poison, is at once detected, and nauseated, when presented to
        us in a concentrated form; but a fallacy which, when stated barely in a few sentences, would not deceive
        a child, may deceive half the world if diluted in a quarto volume."
        (Richard Whately, Elements of Logic, 7th ed. 1831)
        "As creeping ivy clings to wood or stone,
        And hides the ruin that it feeds upon,
        So sophistry cleaves close to and protects
        Sin's rotten trunk, concealing its defects."(William Cowper, "The Progress of Error")
        Walter Lippmann on Free Speech and Sophistry: "If there is a dividing line between liberty and license, it
        is where freedom of speech is no longer respected as a procedure of the truth and becomes the
        unrestricted right to exploit the ignorance and to incite the passions of the people. Then freedom is such
        a hullabaloo of sophistry, propaganda, special pleading, lobbying, and salesmanship that it is difficult to
        remember why freedom of speech is worth the pain and trouble of defending it... It is sophistry to
        pretend that in a free country a man has some sort of inalienable or constitutional right to deceive his
        fellow man. There is no more right to deceive than there is a right to swindle, to cheat, or to pick
        pockets."
        (Walter Lippmannm, Essays in the Public Philosophy, 1955)
        Playfulness in Sophistry: "[A] recurrent feature of sophistic rhetoric is a love of paradox and of playing
        with words and ideas... Some of the playful element in sophistry derives from an effort to teach
        rhetorical methods by using subjects that will interest students to whom more serious subjects might
        seem tiresome. An effort to engage young minds in rhetorical exercises by unrealistic but exciting
        themes is also a feature of declamation as it developed in the Hellenistic and Roman periods. Playfulness
        in sophistry also sometimes reflects a disillusion with a seemingly self-righteous and complacent
        religious or political establishment that refuses to question traditional values and practices."

    <p>Sophism/Sufism: an argument apparently correct in form but actually invalid. especially : such an
        argument used to deceive. When someone deliberately tries to trick you by making a false statement,
        that's a sophism. Inventing statistics to back up your personal belief that dogs are smarter than humans
        is one example of sophism.
        Fact-checking the statements politicians make is important, in order to uncover sophisms they might be
        using. If a candidate falsely claims that the crime rate in a city is rising so that he can gain the support of
        voters who believe he'll be tough on crime, his statement is a sophism. The word comes from the Old
        French sophime, "fallacy or false argument," and its root, the Greek sophisma, "clever device or stage
        trick."

    <p>Sophist/Sufi (Ahl-e-Tareeqat/Mushrik): A sophist (Greek: σοφιστής, romanized: sophistēs) was a teacher
        in ancient Greece in the fifth and fourth centuries BC. Sophists specialized in one or more subject areas,
        such as philosophy, rhetoric, music, athletics and mathematics. They taught arete, "virtue" or
        "excellence", predominantly to young statesmen and nobility. The Greek word σοφός, sophos, 'a wise
        man' is related to the noun σοφία, sophia, 'wisdom'. Since the times of Homer it commonly referred to
        an expert in his profession or craft. Charioteers, sculptors, or military experts could be referred to
        as sophoi in their occupations. The word has gradually come to connote general wisdom and especially
        wisdom in human affairs such as politics, ethics, and household management. This was the meaning
        ascribed to the Greek Seven Sages of 7th and 6th century BC (such as Solon and Thales), and it was the
        meaning that appears in the histories of Herodotus.
        The word σοφός gives rise to the verb σοφίζω, sophizo, 'to instruct / make learned', the passive voice of
        which means "to become or be wise", or "to be clever or skilled". From the verb is derived the
        noun σοφιστής, sophistes, which originally meant "a master of one's craft" and later "a prudent man" or
        "wise man".[1] The word for "sophist" in various languages comes from sophistes.
        The word "sophist" could be combined with other Greek words to form compounds. Examples
        include meteorosophist, which roughly translates to "expert in celestial phenomena"; gymnosophist (or
        "naked sophist", a word used to refer to Indian philosophers), deipnosophist or "dinner sophist" (as in
        the title of Athenaeus's Deipnosophistae), and iatrosophist, a type of physician in the later Roman
        period.
        History
        In the second half of the 5th century BC, particularly in Athens, "sophist" came to denote a class of
        mostly itinerant intellectuals who taught courses in various subjects, speculated about the nature of
        language and culture, and employed rhetoric to achieve their purposes, generally to persuade or
        convince others. "Sophists did, however, have one important thing in common: whatever else they did
        or did not claim to know, they characteristically had a great understanding of what words would
        entertain or impress or persuade an audience."[2] Sophists went to Athens to teach because the city
        was flourishing at the time. It was good employment for those good at debate, which was a speciality of
        the first sophists, and they received the fame and fortune they were seeking. Protagoras is generally
        regarded as the first of these professional sophists.
        A few sophists claimed that they could find the answers to all questions. Most of these sophists are
        known today primarily through the writings of their opponents (particularly Plato and Aristotle), which
        makes it difficult to assemble an unbiased view of their practices and teachings. In some cases, such as
        Gorgias, original rhetorical works are extant, allowing the author to be judged on his own terms, but in
        most cases, knowledge about what individual sophists wrote or said comes from fragmentary
        quotations that lack context and are usually hostile. The Greeks were “experimenting with a new form of
        government, democracy” (W. Keith, 5). Therefore,
        they were navigating how to make decisions without a higher authority. They needed to create laws
        based on demand and popular vote of the people. Back in the fifth century they did not have mass
        media, printing presses, and barely any texts. They mostly relied on speech. This meant that “the
        Athenians needed a strategy for effectively talking to other people in juries, in forums, and in the
        senate” (W. Keith, 5). This is when the sophist began to come about. Originally known as Sicilians, they
        began to teach Athenians how to speak in a persuasive manner in order to work with the courts and
        senate. It is not really known how these Sicilians, who came to be Sophists, initially grew an interest to
        teach others how to speak persuasively. However, the interest in receiving training from the Sophists
        increased. (The Origins of Rhetoric Keith & Lundberg)
        Sophists could be described both as teachers and philosophers, having travelled about in Greece
        teaching their students various life skills, particularly rhetoric and public speaking. These were useful
        qualities of the time, during which persuasive ability had a large influence on one's political power and
        economic wealth. Athens became the center of the sophists' activity, due to the city's freedom of
        speech for non-slave citizens and its wealth of resources. The sophists as a group had no set teachings,
        and they lectured on subjects that were as diverse as semantics and rhetoric, to ontology,
        and epistemology. Most sophists claimed to teach arete ("excellence" or "virtue") in the management
        and administration of not only one's affairs, but the city's as well. Before the 5th century BC, it was
        believed that aristocratic birth qualified a person for arete and politics. However, Protagoras, who is
        regarded as the first sophist, argued that arete was the result of training rather than birth.</p>

    <p>Sophiology/Tareeqat (ek tarha ka shirk): Sophiology (Russian: Софиология, by detractors also
        called Sophianism Софианство or Sophism Софизм) is a controversial school of thought in Russian
        Orthodoxy which holds that Divine Wisdom (or Sophia) is to be identified with God's essence, and that
        the Divine Wisdom is in some way expressed in the world as 'creaturely' wisdom.[1] This notion has
        often been understood or misunderstood (depending upon one's point of view) as introducing a
        feminine "fourth hypostasis" into the Trinity.</p>

        To slump is to fall or slouch down. It's also a downturn in performance — a struggling ballplayer and a
        sinking economy are both in a slump.
        There are many kinds of slumps, but they all involve things going downhill. If you slide down in your
        chair, you slump. Other slumps are less physical. If a successful quarterback starts losing games and
        throwing interceptions, that's a slump. The original meaning of slump, back in the 1670s, was "fall or
        sink into a muddy place," while the more figurative meanings came much later.

    <p>Self-Adornment: is a topic of Human development. Dress is the most obvious status symbol, and to be
        dressed attractively and in fashion gives a sense of well-being and confidence. The human-being uses
        self adornment (dress, cosmetics, tattoos for example) to express physically his or her interior being and
        personality. The clothes a person wears and the way in which he or she wears them, the colours he or
        she chooses, express a fundamental and basic reality; and traditionally specific societal groupings have
        adopted particular forms of dress. The scriptures refer to the removal of earthly garments and being
        clad in heavenly garments; Christ refers to the guest being excluded from the wedding becomes he has
        not put on the appropriate clothing.
        In present-day society, uniform is seen as having no links with individual personality, since it irons out all
        individual and social distinctions; the desire to express individuality is cited as one reason for the habit
        of ordained priests to wear lay clothes and of military men to prefer to wear civilian dress. On the other
        hand, uniform is a powerful symbol in that it demonstrates visibly the role an individual plays. Some
        "uniforms" are highly symbolic in content. For example, the habit of a Zen patriarch demonstrates,
        through its round hat a knowledge of the heavens, through its square shoes a knowledge of the earth,
        and through its bells an understanding of universal harmony. The wearing of white (for baptism,
        confirmation, and as a bride) are traditional demonstrations of inner purity. The Chinese nobleman demonstrated
        in his clothing: harmony (12 bands representing the 12 months of the year), rounded
        sleeves (graceful bearing), straight-cut back (rectitude), and the horizontal lower edging (a heart at
        peace). The muraqq'a or patched frock granted to a novice by his shaykh at the end of mystical training
        in the Sufi system may indicate: by its collar, patience or annihilation of intercourse with others; by its
        sleeves, fear and hope or observance and continence; by its two gussets, contraction and dilation or
        poverty and purity; by its belt, self-abnegation or persistence in contemplation; by its hem, soundness in
        faith or tranquillity in the presence of God; by its fringe, sincerity or settlement in the abode of union.
        The tendency not to wear uniform or formal clothing therefore demonstrates a diminishing sense of
        symbolism and consecration and, in a way, a rejection of the society or grouping that the uniform
        represents. It may also represent rapid change and mingling of societies - clerical dress, once the sign of
        service, may come to signify male domination; or what indicated virginity in one culture (the wearing of
        white) may mean mourning in another.
        As well as dress, other more permanent forms of adornment - tattoos, filing teeth, binding feet - also
        may have deep ritual significance and be used as demonstrating rites of passage. And the changing of
        personal appearance through plastic surgery has deep psychological effects. An adornment is generally
        an accessory or ornament worn to enhance the beauty or status of the wearer. They are often worn to
        embellish, enhance, or distinguish the wearer, and to define cultural, social, or religious status within a
        specific community. When worn to show economic status, the items are often either rare or
        prohibitively expensive to others. Adornments are usually colourful, and worn to attract attention.
        They have a long history, around the world, from feathers or bone, to modern accessories, such as
        jewellery.[1] Items of adornment are also used by warriors, and by other members of the military to
        show rank or achievement.[2]
        These include cosmetics, jewellery, clothing accessories, facial hair, fingernail modification, piercing, lip
        plates, tattooing, braiding, and headgear. Groups who practice adornment include the yakuza, military,
        religious institutions, tribal groups, and the punk culture.[3] Items of adornment can tell us about a
        person's rank, social status, gender role, area of origin, etc. An example would be the beaded jewelry
        worn by the Maasai tribe, which is very specific to them and some related tribes. Stephen Davies’ new
        book builds on his earlier book Artful Species, which considers the evolution of human art making and
        the development of the capacity for aesthetic appreciation. Adornment analyses a range of practices in
        which the body is altered for the sake of beautification, including body painting, scarification, tattoos,
        piercings, jewelry, make-up, and clothing.
        More specifically, an early chapter sets out to analytically define decoration as “making special by
        aesthetic enhancement” (which entails a clear aesthetic intention on the part of the adorner) and then
        fleshes out the definition by considering the relationship between beauty and different forms of
        functionality. Davies’ ensuing discussions of adornment practices are full of anthropological and crosscultural
        details that foster deep appreciation of how they reflect cultural beliefs and values and, more
        generally, how fundamentally human it is to adorn oneself. For example, he considers the Paleolithic
        origins of tattooing, then facial tattooing practices used in Melanesia, Africa, and the early Americas for
        purposes of cultural identity.

    <p>The frame on which a bed is laid. English (West Yorkshire and Lancashire):: in Yorkshire and Lancashire a
        habitational name primarily from Stead near Storiths in Hazlewood (Skipton Yorkshire) which became a grange of
        Bolton Priory. Alternative origins might include Stead Farm in Nether Hoyland (Yorkshire) and Stidd in
        Ribchester
        (Lancashire) but it is not known if this latter produced a surviving hereditary surname. Across England the name
        may
        arise from one or other minor places which were also named with Middle English stede ‘farm estate; hamlet’ (Old
        English stede); for example The Stude in Church Lawford (Warwickshire). The word was especially common in minor
        names and field names in south and southeastern England. variant of Steed.</p>
    <br>
    <p> Middle English stede, from Old English stede, steode "particular place, place in general, position occupied by
        someone;" also "standing, firmness, stability, fixity," from Proto-Germanic *stadi- (source also of Old Saxon
        stedi,
        Old Frisian sted, Old Norse staðr "place, spot; stop, pause; town," Swedish stad, Dutch stede "place," Old High
        German stat, German Stadt "town," Gothic staþs "place").

        This is from PIE *steti-, suffixed form of root *sta- "to stand, make or be firm." Related to stand, equivalent
        to
        Latin statio and Greek stasis, and compare instead.

        Now chiefly in compounds or phrases. The meaning "assistance, use, benefit, advantage" is from c. 1300. From
        mid-13c. as "site for a building;" from mid-14c. as "property or estate in land." The meaning "frame on which a
        bed
        is laid" is from c. 1400.

        Middle English stead sometimes was used for "town, city." The German use of Stadt for "town, city" "is a late
        development from c. 1200 when the term began to replace Burg" [Cambridge Dictionary of English Place-Names]. The
        Steads was 16c. English for "the Hanseatic cities."

    <p> <strong>Self-Subsisting:</strong> able to take care of oneself or itself without outside help.
        <br>
        Self-Subsisting.(LAW INSIDER).
        [72] Self-subsistence means independence of anything outside itself, i.e. absolute self-sufficiency, i.e.
        complete transcendence over the conditions of phenomenal existence in which such uncompromised self-sufficiency
        is impossible. In the phenomenal world of being self-sufficiency means being one’s own final, formal, efficient
        and material cause[73] - something that no phenomenal thing can be. Yet God is exactly that from the phenomenal
        perspective. Thus, like the concept of self-causation in Plotinus, the concept of self-subsistence paradoxically
        unifies two contradictory perspectives and modes of discourse.

    <br>
    <p>According to bahaii' faith: the term "self-subsisting", which Bahá'u'lláh often uses to characterize God, "means
        nothing" in the English language. It is likely that this term signifies in some way a basic concept of the
        Faith; namely, that creation is an emanation from God, without Whose continuing bounty and grace it would cease
        to exist. The term thus underscores the immense contrast between our reality, which is related to the contingent
        world, and His reality which is independent of any cause and which entirely transcends the world of being.
        Indeed, the point is that He is the Cause of being itself. There is a way to deduce such a meaning, however,
        solely from the common meaning of the words. According to its primary dictionary definition, "to subsist" means
        to have existence, to persist or continue. The addition of "self" makes it reflexive. Knowing just these two
        things, can we not then say that if God is self-subsisting it means that there is nothing other than Himself
        upon which He depends for His continuing existence? In other words, He exists in and of Himself without being
        dependent on any other cause: He has no creator and there is nothing prior to Him.</p>

    <br>
    <p>God has the attribute of self-existence or what is called aseity (ah-SAY-ity). This comes from two Latin root
        words that mean “from” (a) and “self” (se). Thus, aseity literally means “from himself” (aseite). This does not
        mean that God is self-caused, but that he is uncaused.[1] God possesses “the ground of His existence in
        Himself,”[2] and he “exists in and of Himself, independent of anything else.”[3] Consequently, God “does not
        need us or the rest of creation for anything, yet we and the rest of creation can glorify him and bring him
        joy.”[4]

        Biblical Basis
        Some passages speak directly to God’s self-existence. Jesus said, “Just as the Father has life in Himself (en
        heautō), even so He gave to the Son also to have life in Himself (en heautō)” (Jn. 5:26). In the immediate
        context of this statement, Jesus refers to both the Father and the Son having the ability to give life to the
        dead. This is life that they possess in themselves.

        God is the Creator who needs nothing from humans. Thus, Paul states, “The God who made the world and all things
        in it, since He is Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made with hands; 25 nor is He served by
        human hands, as though He needed anything, since He Himself gives to all people life and breath and all things”
        (Acts 17:24-25). Since God has no needs, you and I depend on him for our very existence. Paul continues, “In Him
        we live and move and exist” (Acts 17:28).

        God’s name implies his self-existence. When Moses encountered God at the burning bush, Moses asked God to tell
        him his name. God replied, “I AM WHO I AM. This is what you are to say to the Israelites: ‘I AM has sent me to
        you’” (Ex. 3:14 NIV). Essentially, this name communicates that “God’s existence and character are determined by
        himself alone and are not dependent on anyone or anything else.”[5] In effect, God is saying, “I am the only who
        always is.”

        We can also develop a solid basis for God’s self-existence by studying the correlation of three central biblical
        teachings: (1) God existed before creation and is independent of creation, (2) God sustains the existence of
        every created thing, and (3) God is immortal.[6]

        (1) God existed before creation and is independent of creation
        The Bible opens with the words, “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth” (Gen. 1:1). This, of
        course, refers to “the beginning of time itself”[7] and an “absolute beginning point in time.”[8] Elsewhere, the
        psalmist writes, “Before the mountains were born or You gave birth to the earth and the world, even from
        everlasting to everlasting, You are God” (Ps. 90:2).

        God declares, “I am the Alpha and the Omega, who is and who was and who is to come” (Rev. 1:8). This is a
        rhetorical device that states the “polar opposites in order to highlight everything between the opposites.”[9]
        For instance, at his wedding, a man will promise to love his wife in “sickness and in health.” Of course,
        everything in between is also implied. By calling himself the “Alpha and the Omega,” God is stating that he has
        existed from the beginning of creation and all the way to the end. He is the “the first and the last” of
        creation (Rev. 1:17; 22:13; Isa. 41:4; 44:6; 48:12).

        (2) God sustains the existence of every created thing
        God created “all things.” John writes, “All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him nothing came
        into being that has come into being” (Jn. 1:3). Without God, literally “nothing” would exist beside him. God’s
        creation extends to both the material universe as well as all of spiritual reality. Paul writes, “In him all
        things were created: things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers
        or authorities; all things have been created through him and for him” (Col. 1:16 NIV). Finally, in Revelation,
        we read, “You created all things, and because of Your will they existed, and were created” (Rev. 4:11). All of
        creation owes its existence to God.

        But God is not only the Creator of the universe; he is also the Sustainer of the universe. It is because of
        Jesus that “all things hold together” (Col. 1:17), and he “upholds all things by the word of His power” (Heb.
        1:3). That is, if Jesus chose to relax his grip on the existence of reality, the universe would fly apart.

        (3) God is immortal
        Repeatedly, Scripture calls God the “living God” (Mt. 16:16; Acts 14:15; 2 Cor. 3:3, etc.). Paul states that God
        is “incorruptible” (Rom. 1:23), “immortal” (1 Tim. 1:17), and indeed, God “alone possesses immortality” (1 Tim.
        6:16). God “lives forever” (Isa. 57:15). This means that God will never cease to exist.

        If God is self-existent, then how can we “please” him?
        As a self-existent being, God doesn’t need us. Yet, repeatedly, we are told that we are able to “please God” (1
        Thess. 4:1) and “please Him in all respects” (Col. 1:10). How can God be pleased with us if he doesn’t need us?
        Because of our position in Christ, God doesn’t love us any more or less. But how can we please God if he’s
        always well-pleased with us?

        In response, when we speak of “pleasing God,” this doesn’t mean that we’re beginning from a position of God
        being displeased with us. We are “in the Beloved” (Eph. 1:6), and we are always “beloved children” (Eph. 5:1).
        This is the highest status that we could ever ask for or even imagine.

        Our position “in Christ” never changes. In this objective sense, we are always pleasing to God. However, in our
        condition, we can choose to please God by following him and trusting him. We deny the doctrine of the
        impassibility of God, where God is so immutable that he cannot feel emotions. Paul writes, “Do not grieve the
        Holy Spirit” (Eph. 4:30). This, of course, means that God is grieved for our sake—not for his own. That is, God
        is grieved when we forfeit the happiness, joy, and eternal rewards for a life of bitterness, anger, and other
        sins (Eph. 4:31).

        Perhaps an imperfect analogy might help. My sons can never do anything that will cause them to cease being my
        sons. That is a permanent reality. I will always love my sons—no matter what they do. Indeed, some parents say
        that rebellious children often grasp their hearts more because the parents labor in love and prayer over such
        children.

        That being said, it would be utterly odd to say that my unconditional love precludes me from being affected by
        the actions of my sons. When my kids show love to their mother, for example, I can find this very emotionally
        moving. But this doesn’t make me love them more or less. It only changes emotional states in my heart. To bring
        this full circle, God’s love is permanent and unchanging. Yet, he allows himself to feel. And our actions affect
        the heart of God.

        God genuinely delights in us (Isa. 62:3-5; Zeph. 3:17-18). Grudem writes, “God does not need us for anything,
        yet it is the amazing fact of our existence that he chooses to delight in us and to allow us to bring joy to his
        heart. This is the basis for personal significance in the lives of all God’s people: to be significant to God is
        to be significant in the most ultimate sense. No greater personal significance can be imagined.”[10]

        If God is self-existent, why does God get jealous of humans who reject him?
        The Bible condemns jealousy (Jas. 3:14; 1 Cor. 3:3; Gal. 5:19-21), but it states that God is a jealous God (Ex.
        20:5). How can God condemn us for something he himself does?

        To begin, not all jealousy is bad. Paul writes, “I am jealous for you with a godly jealousy” (2 Cor. 11:2).

        Second, God is jealous for our sake—not his own. Since God is the greatest conceivable good, we only bring harm
        to ourselves and others when we place anything else at the center of our lives. If a homeowner saved his
        goldfish rather than his newborn baby in a house fire, we could see that something was wrong with his moral
        priorities. It’s easy to see that the baby possesses infinitely more value than the fish. God, of course, is the
        greatest conceivable good, so placing anything else at the center of our lives will ultimately lead to
        self-destruction.

        Third, if God was apathetic about our rejection of him, that wouldn’t be loving. Our love for finite things over
        God ultimately results in destruction, damage, and despair. What would it mean if God sat idly by as he watched
        us choose those things? Copan writes, “A wife who doesn’t get jealous and angry when another woman is flirting
        with her husband isn’t really all that committed to the marriage relationship. A marriage without the potential
        for jealousy when an intruder threatens isn’t much of a marriage. Outrage, pain, anguish—these are the
        appropriate responses to such a deep violation.”[11]

        Fourth, since God is the greatest conceivable good, it wouldn’t be humble for God to pretend that he isn’t.
        Again, Copan writes, “For Yo-Yo Ma to claim that he ‘really can’t play the cello all that well’ or for Landon
        Donovan to say he ‘can’t really play soccer’ would be equally out of touch with reality—a false humility.
        (What’s more, these kinds of statements are usually a backdoor attempt to get attention!)”[12]

        In conclusion, God is the only being in existence who is worthy of worship. Devoting our love and adoration
        toward anything else is at the heart of the human condition (Lk. 10:27). Stott writes, “The essence of sin is
        man substituting himself for God, while the essence of salvation is God substituting himself for man. Man
        asserts himself against God and puts himself where only God deserves to be; God sacrifices himself for man and
        puts himself where only man deserves to be. Man claims prerogatives that belong to God alone; God accepts
        penalties that belong to man alone.”[13]

        Doesn’t God need a cause for his existence?
        Modern atheists often argue that God must need a cause for his existence. After all, “if everything must have a
        cause, then God must have a cause.”[14] Indeed, we often hear the question, “Who caused God?”[15] Yet, this is a
        particularly weak criticism for a number of reasons.

        For one, this commits a definitional error. By definition, God is an uncreated and uncaused Being. As a
        necessary being, it is a logical contradiction for God to not exist. This isn’t evidence for the existence of
        God. Rather, by definition, “if God is as he is described in Scripture, he must exist.”[16]

        Therefore, the question, “Who created God?” is the same as asking, “Why doesn’t a triangle have five sides?” or
        “Why is a bachelor unmarried?” These things are true by definition. Thus, asking “Who created God?” is the same
        as asking “Who created the uncreated Creator?” When we understand the definition of God, we realize that this
        question is nonsensical.

        Second, until recently, atheists never had a problem affirming the concept of self-existence. In a famous debate
        in 1948, a Christian philosopher asked atheist Bertrand Russell why the universe existed. Russell famously
        replied, “I should say that the universe is just there, and that’s all.”[17] The assertion that the universe was
        “just there” seemed perfectly plausible for atheists at the time.

        Today, however, cosmologists state that the universe had a space-time beginning. This demonstrates that the
        universe isn’t self-existent, and it requires a transcendent cause. After the discovery of the Big Bang, all of
        a sudden, the concept of self-existence seems incoherent. This is special pleading at its worst.

        Third, something (or someone) needs to possess the attribute of self-existence; otherwise, nothing would exist.
        To illustrate, imagine if you needed a loan from a bank. Monday morning, you walk into the bank and ask for
        $100,000 in cash. Assuming your credit is good, the bank would be willing to give you the money.

        But there’s just one problem: The bank doesn’t have the money in their vault. So, in order to give you the loan,
        your bank decides to borrow the money from a neighboring bank. However, the neighboring bank doesn’t have the
        cash, either. So, they have to ask a third bank for the money (and so on and so forth).

        Now, think about it: If there isn’t a bank with cash in its vault, will you ever get your money? Don’t count on
        it. An endless string of empty bank vaults will never get you your money. We cannot borrow money from a bank
        that possesses no money.

        In the same way, something in reality needs to possess self-existence. We can capture the logic of this concept
        in this way:

        (1) Either the universe is self-existent, or something beyond the universe is self-existent.

        (2) The universe is not self-existent.

        (3) Therefore, something beyond the universe is self-existent.

        Since the universe is not self-existent (it began to exist at the Big Bang), it makes good sense to affirm that
        something beyond the universe has the attribute of self-existence. Therefore, far from being an argument against
        the coherence of theism, this objection actually demonstrates a strong argument in favor of theism.

        If “all things” came into being through God (Jn. 1:3), then what about abstract objects? (e.g. numbers, sets,
        and laws of logic)
        Does the number 3 exist? What about the laws of logic? What about an endless string of natural numbers,
        mathematical sets, and other properties? Here’s the dilemma:

        (1) If you say that abstract objects don’t exist, then this seems incoherent. How could we affirm that the laws
        of logic do not exist without breaking the law of non-contradiction? Moreover, even before creation, God existed
        with one nature in three persons. Doesn’t this mean that the number 1 and the number 3 have existed for
        eternity?

        (2) On the other hand, if you say that abstract objects do exist, then this means that you affirm an infinite
        amount of eternal, uncreated, and necessary things. God didn’t create these abstract objects. Rather, they were
        uncaused and coeternal with God, existing by necessity for all of eternity.

        This is the challenge of Platonism. Craig and Moreland explain this difficulty when they write,

        Not only is there an infinite number of such objects (there is an infinite number of natural numbers alone), but
        there are higher and higher orders of infinities of such objects, infinities of infinities, so that God is
        utterly dwarfed by their unimaginable multitude. God finds himself amid uncreated, infinite realms of beings
        that exist just as necessarily and independently as he. The dependence of physical creation on God for its
        existence becomes an infinitesimal triviality in comparison with the existence of the infinitude of beings that
        exist independent of him.[18]

        Consequently, this objection creates difficulties for the repeated teaching of Scripture that God created “all
        things.” John writes that “all things came into being through Him” (Jn. 1:3; cf. Col. 1:16-17; Heb. 1:3; Rev.
        4:11). How do Christian philosophers respond to this objection? Two views are often espoused:

        VIEW #1: Modified Platonism
        Some Christian philosophers hold to a view called modified Platonism. This view states that abstract objects
        like numbers, sets, and laws of logic were timelessly created by God. Under this view, these things “are not
        created by God at any time but rather are timelessly created by him.” That is, “God is not temporally prior to
        the existence of such objects, but he is causally or explanatorily prior to their existence.”[19] However, there
        are two critiques of this view:

        Critique #1: If these abstract objects exist necessarily, they are indeed independent of God’s will. In other
        words, God was forced to create reality with these abstract objects. Of course, advocates of this view would
        retort that these abstract objects don’t coerce God to do anything. Indeed, theologians have long held that God
        is bound by certain logical or mathematical laws (e.g. God cannot create a world in which 2 + 2 = 5). Therefore,
        they don’t really feel that these abstract objects truly control God’s will.

        Critique #2: In order to create certain properties, God must have these properties to begin with. But if God
        needs to have the property in himself first, then the property must exist for him to have it. That being said,
        advocates of this view argue that these properties are identical with properties that exist within God’s
        essential nature. Thus, these properties are not separate from God’s nature; they are an essential part of it.

        VIEW #2: Conceptualism
        Other Christian philosophers propose a view called conceptualism. This view holds that these abstract objects
        are merely divine concepts that have their existence in the mind of God. Hence, abstract objects like numbers,
        sets, or laws of logic “do not exist independent of God nor even outside of God but only within his mind.”[20]
        Under this view, the abstract objects in our world are necessary expressions of the thoughts of God. However,
        there are two critiques of this perspective as well:

        Critique #1: This view confuses concepts with objects. God’s conception of these abstract objects is not
        identical to the object itself.

        Critique #2: In order to create certain properties, God must have these properties to begin with. If the divine
        mind contains these abstract objects, then he would need them in his mind before he could have them.

        Conclusion
        These two views (modified Platonism and Augustinian conceptualism) are very difficult to comprehend and to
        communicate. Frankly, this discussion is beyond our paygrade! Even Moreland and Craig conclude, “There are
        extremely difficult and unresolved issues here, and we can look forward to further discussion of these questions
        on the part of Christian philosophers. For now, we can agree that God is uniquely self-existent, and abstract
        objects, if they exist at all, should be thought of as in some way grounded in God.”[21]

        We hope that this short explanation will help the reader at least understand the challenge of Platonism, and
        these explanations will help frame the discussion. For more on this topic, see William Lane Craig, God and
        Abstract Objects (2017).

        If God wasn’t self-existent, what implications would this have for our lives?
        If God wasn’t self-existent, we would feel like God needed a relationship with us. Did God create you out of
        cosmic loneliness or existential dread? Did he need a companion in the infinite solitude of his eternal
        existence? Not at all. God was doing perfectly fine before creation, and he could’ve existed in that harmonious
        state for eternity. It was only out of an abundance of love that he chose to create you.

        Some people are needier than others, but let’s face it: Everyone you’ve ever met has needs (including you!). We
        are broken selves who are trying to meet our needs from other broken selves. Yet, God isn’t this way. There’s no
        bottom to his reservoir of infinite love. He has a superabundance of love, life, and security. He has the
        ability to just give and give and give some more. You need to increasingly learn to depend upon the One who
        depends upon no one.

        This also means that God doesn’t want to take anything from you that worth anything. After all, why would he
        want anything that you possess? He’s already fully satisfied within himself. This means that if God asks you to
        give something over to him, it’s only because it’s for your benefit—not his. Because God is self-existent, you
        never need to worry about outgiving God!

        If God wasn’t self-existent, we would feel like God needed us to accomplish his plan and purposes. Perhaps you
        wouldn’t say this out loud, but you might act as though God needs you to play your part in reaching the world
        for Christ. Very easily, you could find yourself acting like the plans and purposes of God will succeed or fail
        based on the efficacy of your efforts.

        This sort of thinking is out of touch with reality. God isn’t dependent on you; you are dependent on him. Human
        agency matters, but only because God has chosen to work through you—not because he needs you. God is not “served
        by human hands, as though He needed anything, since He Himself gives to all people life and breath and all
        things” (Acts 17:25).

        God could surely do a better job accomplishing his purposes himself, or he could choose to send an angel to
        spread his message of love and forgiveness to the world. Indeed, someday, God will do exactly this. John writes,
        “I saw another angel flying through the sky, carrying the eternal Good News to proclaim to the people who belong
        to this world—to every nation, tribe, language, and people” (Rev. 14:6 NLT). This should shatter your delusions
        of grandeur regarding how much God needs you in his plans and purposes. You have no job security! He could
        replace you whenever he chooses.

        Instead, serving God is a great privilege that is extended to us. This is why Paul writes that it is an act of
        “mercy” for humans to have a “ministry” for God (2 Cor. 4:1).

        If God wasn’t self-existent, we would boast about the work we accomplished for God. After all, if God needed us,
        then we would have a good reason to boast. God would be in our debt. We could emphasize just how much our
        sacrifices for God really mattered, and how much he owes us.

        Yet, when you understand the self-existence of God, you see how ludicrous this is. Like a little child drawing a
        picture for his father, you can bring happiness to God when you trust him and serve him (1 Cor. 7:32; Col. 1:10;
        1 Thess. 4:1; Heb. 11:6; 13:16). Yet, you are only serving God with the resources that he ultimately gave you in
        the first place.

        Thus, when David brought sacrifices to God, he prayed loudly, “Who am I and who are my people that we should be
        able to offer as generously as this? For all things come from You, and from Your hand we have given You” (1
        Chron. 29:14). Elsewhere, God says, “If I were hungry I would not tell you, for the world is Mine, and all it
        contains” (Ps. 50:12). Geisler writes, “We can give back to Him only what He has given us.”[22] Giving our lives
        to God is equivalent to giving a grain of sand to the owner of a beach!

        If God wasn’t self-existent, we would worry that God could go away or even die. Everyone in your life will be
        torn away from you at death. Either you will live long enough to see them die, or they will live long enough to
        see you die. Yet, God will never die, and not even death itself will separate you from him (Jn. 14:1-3). Thus,
        Paul writes, “Whether we are awake or asleep, we will live together with Him” (1 Thess. 5:10). Everything in
        life is contingent on circumstances—except God. Erickson writes, “There is one sure thing, and that is that
        there is a God and there always will be.”</p>

    <p>Self-Existent God – The Definition of Aseity
        When we talk about the character of God, we realize that His incommunicable attributes, such as being a
        self-existent God, cannot be seen. An incommunicable attribute refers to an attribute that God does not share or
        “pass on” to us, such as omnipresence or unchangeableness. God’s independence, or self-existence, is defined as:
        God does not need us or the rest of creation for anything, yet we and the rest of creation glorify him and bring
        him joy.1
        Sometimes God’s self-existence is referred to as His aseity (from the Latin words a + se, which mean “existence
        derived from itself, having no other source”).2

        People may assume that God created human beings because He needed companionship and was lonely. This would mean
        that God is not entirely independent of creation. Or, in order for God to find complete satisfaction and
        happiness, He would need to create humans to fulfill His existence. In John 17:5, Jesus prays, “Father, glorify
        me in your presence with the glory I had with you before the world began.” There was love and communication
        between the Father and the Son long before creation. Sharing the glory between the Father and Son provided a
        fellowship with no shortcomings.

        By His very nature, the Scriptures remind us that He is a self-existent God. He was never created and never came
        into being. “You are worthy...to receive glory, honor, and power, for you created all things, and by your will
        they were created and have their being” (Revelation 4:11). While these are words of adoration, it is affirmation
        that God preserves and is the final cause of all things.
        “Our Maker exists in an eternal, self-sustaining, necessary way—necessary, that is, in the sense that God does
        not have it in Him to go out of existence, just as we do not have it in us to live forever. We necessarily age
        and die, because it is our present nature to do that; God necessarily continues forever unchanged, because it is
        His eternal nature to do that. This is one of many contrasts between creature and Creator.”3
        God is not dependent on any part of creation for His existence or His nature. Before the earth gave birth to
        life or before the beginning of time, God had being.

        Self-Existent God – He is Totally Unique
        As the one true Self-Existent God, His being is totally unique. Beyond God not needing creation for anything;
        God would not need the creation for anything. The difference between the Creator and human is so vast that He
        exists fundamentally in a different order of being. God essentially exists in an infinitely superior, stronger,
        more excellent way. It’s as if one compared the sun and a candle, the ocean and a raindrop, or the universe and
        the room we are sitting in.

        God reminds Job of the infinite distance and imbalance between man and Him, showing that the Creator alone is
        unique. “Where were you when I laid the earth’s foundation? Tell me, if you understand. Who marked off its
        dimensions? Surely you know! Who stretched a measuring line across it?” (Job 38:4-5). There is no imperfection
        or limitation in the Creator. All else can pass away in an instant; God inevitably exists forever.

        There have been objections to God’s aseity, suggesting that a self-existent God or Being is a self-caused Being.
        Some argue that a self-caused being is impossible for it would be ontologically prior to itself.4 We can
        attribute everything in the world that is able to be perceived through our senses, to something. But this
        determination cannot be continued into infinity. By reason, there was something existing prior to all other
        things. Thomas Aquinas stated that God is the prime mover: “...in the world, some things are in motion...it is
        necessary to arrive at a first mover, moved by no other; and this everyone understands to be God."5 One thing
        caused the first movement—God is an uncaused Being.

        Self-Existent God – Are We Insignificant?
        One might wonder, “Why would a self-existent God bother with our existence?” We must guard against the idea that
        God’s independence makes our existence insignificant. We are very meaningful because God created us and by His
        will has proclaimed that we would be meaningful to Him. God speaks of His sons and daughters from the ends of
        the earth as “everyone who is called by my name, whom I created for my glory, whom I formed and made” (Isaiah
        43:6). God derives great pleasure in adopting us as His children (Ephesians 1:5). He freely chooses us to be
        recipients of His power (Luke 9:1–2), peace (John 14:27), joy (John 5:11), grace (James 4:6), and eternal life
        (John 10:27–28). To be significant to the Self-Existent God is to be significant in the most ultimate sense.</p>

    <p> <strong> Stratum corneum: </strong> Layer of the Skin. As the outermost layer of the epidermis, the stratum
        corneum is the first line of defense for the body, serving an essential role as a protective skin barrier
        against the external environment. The stratum corneum aids in hydration and water retention, which prevents
        cracking of the skin, and is made up of corneocytes, which are anucleated keratinocytes that have reached the
        final stage of keratinocyte differentiation. Corneocytes retain keratin filaments within a filaggrin matrix, and
        the cornified lipid envelope replaces the keratinocyte plasma membrane. These flat cells organize in a brick and
        mortar formation within a lipid-rich extracellular matrix. Pathophysiology of the stratum corneum is typically
        secondary to either protein or lipid defects. Other clinically significant signs include parakeratosis, which is
        the incomplete maturation of keratinocytes, and the morphological retention of nuclei in the stratum corneum.
        Abnormal parakeratosis of the stratum corneum can appear in patients with psoriasis, chronic eczema, and
        squamous cell carcinoma.[1] Scaling, or visible peeling and flaking of the skin, furthermore is a salient
        manifestation of diseases of the stratum corneum. The stratum corneum is the outermost layer of the epidermis
        and marks the final stage of keratinocyte maturation and development. Keratinocytes at the basal layer of the
        epidermis are proliferative, and as the cells mature up the epidermis, they slowly lose proliferative potential
        and undergo programmed destruction. </p>
    <br>
    <p> The stratum corneum (Latin for 'horny layer') is the outermost layer of the epidermis. Consisting of dead
        tissue, it protects underlying tissue from infection, dehydration, chemicals and mechanical stress. It is
        composed of 15–20 layers of flattened cells with no nuclei and cell organelles.

        Among its properties are mechanical shear, impact resistance, water flux and hydration regulation, microbial
        proliferation and invasion regulation, initiation of inflammation through cytokine activation and dendritic cell
        activity, and selective permeability to exclude toxins, irritants, and allergens.[2] The cytoplasm of its cells
        shows filamentous keratin. These corneocytes are embedded in a lipid matrix composed of ceramides, cholesterol,
        and fatty acids.[3]

        Desquamation is the process of cell shedding from the surface of the stratum corneum, balancing proliferating
        keratinocytes that form in the stratum basale. These cells migrate through the epidermis towards the surface in
        a journey that takes approximately fourteen days.[4] </p>

    <p> Your skin is your body’s first line of defense against the environment. The stratum corneum is the constantly
        shedding outermost layer. But some skin products you use may be harming and weakening this layer.

        The stratum corneum is the outer layer of the skin (epidermis). It serves as the primary barrier between the
        body and the environment.

        The epidermis is made up of five layers:

        stratum basale: the deepest layer of epidermis, made up of cuboidal and columnar cells
        stratum spinosum: made up of skin cells that are connected by desmosomes giving these cells a spiny appearance
        under a microscope
        stratum granulosum: made up of skin cells with granules containing components that contribute to the formation
        of the outer skin layer
        stratum lucidum: thin, lighter appearing layer only present on the palms and soles
        stratum corneum: the outermost layer of skin, made up of layers of very resilient and specialized skin cells and
        keratin
        The stratum corneum consists of a series of layers of specialized skin cells that are continuously shedding.
        It’s also called the horny layer, as the cells are tougher than most, like an animal’s horn. The stratum corneum
        exists to protect the inner layers of skin.

        Most areas of the stratum corneum are about 20 layers of cells thick. Areas of skin like your eyelids can be
        thinner, while other layers such as your hands and heels may be thicker.

        Stratum corneum function
        Your skin is the biggest organ system in your body. The most important function of the skin is to protect the
        body from things in the environment that may cause harm.

        The skin helps to

        keep your body temperature at a healthy level
        prevent water loss or absorption
        The stratum corneum is sometimes described as a brick wall. The corneocytes that make up the cell envelope are
        layers, like bricks, mortared together by lipids, that create the outer water barrier.

        If everything is working properly in the stratum corneum, the skin layer will help defend you against:

        dehydration
        toxins
        bacteria
        At the same time, it’s protecting the skin layers underneath.

        Unfortunately, some of the products that you use to clean your body can harm the stratum corneum.

        Surfactants, such as hand soap, will bind to the proteins in the skin and allow water loss through the skin and
        weaken the barrier created.

        Using sensitive soap, such as an unscented bar soap, and not over-washing is suggested. Using moisturizers can
        also help to prevent your skin from drying out as well.

        Shop for unscented bar soap online.

        Parts of the stratum corneum
        The stratum corneum is made up of many parts to help protect your lower skin layers. Although the structure
        could be described in vastly greater detail, for ease of basic understanding, you can focus on three primary
        categories.

        The bricks
        The bricks, also called corneocytes, are mostly made up of keratin. Keratin is a protein also found in hair and
        nails.

        Keratinocytes are created in the lower layers of the epidermis and operate with a phospholipid cell membrane,
        which can be quite permeable. When the keratinocytes are pushed to the stratum corneum, they’re transformed into
        corneocytes with a more durable cell envelope.

        A healthy stratum corneum will shed approximately one layer of corneocytes each day. The corneocytes will then
        be replaced with new keratinocytes from a lower layer of the epidermis called the stratum granulosum.

        The desmosomes
        The desmosomes serve to connect the bricks by joining the corneocytes together. These are formed via connections
        of proteins such as corneodesmosin.

        In order for the bricks to shed at a healthy rate, enzymes must dissolve the desmosomes.

        The mortar

        The mortar that secures everything in place is made out of lipids that have been released from tiny lamellar
        bodies that are present in the stratum granulosum. The lipids float into the space between the bricks and
        between the layers of corneocytes.

        The mortar is very important in protecting the lower layers of the skin. It creates the barrier that keeps out
        bacteria and toxins.

        The mortar and whole of the stratum corneum are slightly acidic due to cellular processes that work to produce
        the lipids. The stratum corneum has a pH of around 4 to 5.5. The acidity helps to prevent bacteria growth.

        The takeaway
        The stratum corneum is the outer layer of your epidermis (skin). It’s made up of mostly keratin and lipids. The
        visible cells shed and are replaced from the lower epidermal layers.

        The cells have a 2-week cycle in the stratum corneum. When a keratinocyte enters the stratum corneum, it’s
        changed into a corneocyte and shed within a 2-week period.

        If you’re concerned about your stratum corneum or general skin health, talk with your doctor about a skin care
        regimen that will help your skin’s mortar and bricks stay intact. </p>

    <p> What Is a Surplus?
        A surplus describes the amount of an asset or resource that exceeds the portion that's actively utilized. A
        surplus can refer to a host of different items, including income, profits, capital, and goods. In the context of
        inventories, a surplus describes products that remain sitting on store shelves, unpurchased. In budgetary
        contexts, a surplus occurs when income earned exceeds expenses paid. A budget surplus can also occur within
        governments when there's leftover tax revenue after all government programs are fully financed. KEY TAKEAWAYS
        A surplus describes a level of an asset that exceeds the portion used.
        An inventory surplus occurs when products remain unsold.
        Budgetary surpluses occur when income earned exceeds expenses paid.
        A surplus results from a disconnect between supply and demand for a product, or when some people are willing to
        pay more for a product than other consumers.
        Typically, a surplus causes a market disequilibrium in the supply and demand of a product. This imbalance can
        sometimes mean that the product cannot efficiently flow through the market. Understanding a Surplus
        A surplus isn't necessarily desirable. For example, a manufacturer who over-projects future demand for a given
        product may create too many unsold units, which may consequently contribute to quarterly or annual financial
        losses. A surplus of perishable commodities like grains could cause a permanent loss, as inventory spoils and
        the items become unsellable.

        Economic Surplus
        There are two types of economic surplus: consumer surplus and producer surplus. As a rule, consumer surplus and
        producer surplus are mutually exclusive, in that what's good for one is bad for the other. Consumer Surplus
        A consumer surplus occurs when the price for a product or service is lower than the highest price a consumer
        would willingly pay. Think of an auction, where a buyer holds in his mind a price limit he will not exceed, for
        a certain painting he fancies. A consumer surplus occurs if this buyer ultimately purchases the artwork for less
        than his predetermined limit. In another example, let's assume the price per barrel of oil drops, causing gas
        prices to dip below the price a driver is accustomed to shelling out at the pump. In this case, the consumer
        profits with a surplus.
        Producer Surplus
        A producer surplus occurs when goods are sold at a higher price than the lowest price the producer was willing
        to sell for. In the same auction context, if an auction house sets the opening bid at the lowest price it would
        comfortably sell a painting, a producer surplus occurs if buyers create a bidding war, thus causing the item to
        sell for a higher price, far above the opening minimum. Reasons for Surplus
        A surplus occurs when there is some sort of disconnect between supply and demand for a product, or when some
        people are willing to pay more for a product than others. Hypothetically speaking, if there were a set price for
        a certain popular doll, that everyone was unanimously expected and willing to pay, neither a surplus nor a
        shortage would occur. But this rarely happens in practice, because various people and businesses have different
        price thresholds—both when buying and selling.

        Sellers are constantly competing with other vendors to move as much product as possible, at the best value. If
        demand for the product spikes, the vendor offering the lowest price may run out of supply, which tends to result
        in general market price increases, causing a producer surplus. The opposite occurs if prices go down, and supply
        is high, but there is not enough demand, consequently resulting in a consumer surplus.

        Surpluses often occur when the cost of a product is initially set too high, and nobody is willing to pay that
        price. In such instances, companies often sell the product at a lower cost than initially hoped, in order to
        move stock.
        2001 was the last year the U.S. federal government had a budget surplus. Results of Surplus
        Surplus causes a market disequilibrium in the supply and demand of a product. This imbalance means that the
        product cannot efficiently flow through the market. Fortunately, the cycle of surplus and shortage has a way of
        balancing itself out.

        Sometimes, to remedy this imbalance, the government will step in and implement a price floor or set a minimum
        price for which a good must be sold. This often results in higher price tags than consumers have been paying,
        thus benefiting the businesses.

        More often than not, government intervention is not necessary, as this imbalance tends to naturally correct.
        When producers have a surplus of supply, they must sell the product at lower prices. Consequently, more
        consumers will purchase the product, now that it's cheaper. This results in supply shortages if producers cannot
        meet consumer demand. A shortage in supply causes prices to go back up, consequently causing consumers to turn
        away from the products because of high prices, and the cycle continues. Budget surpluses are expected during
        periods of economic growth. During recessions, when consumer demand declines, budget deficits typically follow.
        Surplus vs. Deficit
        A deficit is essentially the opposite of a surplus. A deficit occurs when expenses exceed revenues, imports
        exceed exports or liabilities exceed assets, resulting in a negative balance. Just as a surplus is not always a
        positive sign, deficits are not always unintentional or the sign of a government or business that's in financial
        trouble. Businesses may deliberately run budget deficits to maximize future earnings opportunities—such as
        retaining employees during slow months to ensure themselves of an adequate workforce in busier times.

        On the surface, a surplus is preferable to a deficit. However, this is an overly simplistic assumption. For
        example, a trade deficit is not inherently bad, as it can be indicative of a strong economy.

        Deficits do carry risks if not handled properly or coupled with a large amount of debt. In the corporate world,
        running a deficit for too long a period can reduce the company's share value or even put it out of business.
        What Is an Example of a Surplus?
        Take this example of a consumer surplus. Let's say that you bought an airline ticket for a flight to Miami
        during school vacation week for $100, but you were expecting and willing to pay $300 for one ticket. The $200
        represents your consumer surplus.

        What Is a Surplus in Economics?
        Economic surplus consists of consumer surplus and producer surplus. Consumer surplus occurs when the price for a
        product or service is lower than the highest price a consumer would willingly pay. A producer surplus is when
        goods are sold at a higher price than the lowest price the producer was willing to sell for. What Is a Surplus
        Auction?
        Surplus property is property the government does not need. Personal property includes assets ranging from office
        equipment and furniture to scientific equipment, heavy machinery, airplanes, vessels, and vehicles. If this
        property cannot be donated to a state or public agency, or nonprofit organization, the general public can buy it
        in an auction.

        How Do You Calculate a Surplus?
        Surplus is the amount of an asset or resource that exceeds the portion that is utilized. To calculate consumer
        surplus one merely needs to subtract the actual price the consumer paid by the amount they were willing to pay.

        The Bottom Line
        A surplus, generally speaking, occurs when there is more of something than is needed. At first glance, that
        might sound like a positive for everyone. However, in reality, when there’s a disconnect between supply and
        demand, somebody inevitably suffers and it doesn't always end well. What Is a Surplus Auction?
        Surplus property is property the government does not need. Personal property includes assets ranging from office
        equipment and furniture to scientific equipment, heavy machinery, airplanes, vessels, and vehicles. If this

        How Do You Calculate a Surplus?
        Surplus is the amount of an asset or resource that exceeds the portion that is utilized. To calculate consumer
        surplus one merely needs to subtract the actual price the consumer paid by the amount they were willing to pay.

        For example, when a business has excess stock and is forced to cut prices to offload what it cannot sell, its
        profits tighten and its stakeholders suffer while consumers happily capitalize. Conversely, a producer surplus
        works the other way around, benefiting the business and squeezing the income of consumers. Ideally, a balance is
        struck to keep all parties happy. Sometimes market dynamics can stray, though, and lead to a nasty recession if
        equilibrium isn't restored in time.

    <p> <strong> Shylock: </strong> Someone who lends money at excessive rates of interest. Shylock is a fictional
        character in William Shakespeare's play The Merchant of
        Venice (c. 1600). A Venetian Jewish moneylender, Shylock is the play's principal villain. His defeat and
        conversion to Christianity form the climax of the story.

        Shylock's characterisation is composed of stereotypes, for instance greediness and vengefulness, although there
        were no legally practising Jews who lived in England during Shakespeare's time. Jews were expelled from the
        country in 1290 by Edward I in the Edict of Expulsion; this was not reversed until the mid-17th century (the
        Cromwell Era). <br> <b> Name </b> Shylock is not a Jewish name. However, some scholars believe it probably
        derives
        from the biblical name Shalah, which is שלח (Šélaḥ) in Hebrew. Shalah is the grandson of Shem and the father of
        Eber, biblical progenitor of Hebrew peoples. All the names of Jewish characters in the play derive from minor
        figures listed in genealogies in the Book of Genesis. It is possible that Shakespeare originally intended the
        name to be pronounced with a short "i", rather than a long one. In this scenario, the modern pronunciation would
        have changed because the standard spelling with a "y" signifies to readers a long 'i' pronunciation. Other
        scholars emphasise that, although the name echoes some Hebrew names, "Shylock" was a common sixteenth-century
        English name that would have been familiar to Shakespeare's fellow Londoners, and the name is notable for its
        Saxon origin, meaning "white-haired". The Shylocks of sixteenth-century London included "goldsmiths, mercers,
        and, most visibly of all, scriveners", according to prominent scholar Stephen Orgel, a Stanford professor who
        serves (with A. R. Braunmuller) as general editor of The Pelican Shakespeare series from Penguin. <br> <b> In
            the
            Play </b> Shylock is a stingy Jew who lends money to his Christian rival Antonio, setting the security at a
        pound of Antonio's flesh. When a bankrupt Antonio defaults on the loan, Shylock demands the pound of flesh. This
        decision is fuelled by his sense of revenge, for Antonio had previously insulted, physically assaulted and spat
        on him in the Rialto (stock exchange of Venice) dozens of times, defiled the "sacred" Jewish religion and had
        also inflicted massive financial losses on him. Meanwhile, Shylock's daughter, Jessica, falls in love with
        Antonio's friend Lorenzo and converts to Christianity, leaves Shylock's house and steals vast riches from him,
        which add to Shylock's rage and harden his resolve for revenge. In the end – due to the efforts of Antonio's
        well-wisher, Portia – Shylock is charged with attempted murder of a Christian, carrying a possible death
        penalty, and Antonio is freed without punishment. Shylock is then ordered to surrender half of his wealth and
        property to the state and the other half to Antonio. However, as an act of "mercy", Antonio modifies the
        verdict, asking Shylock to hand over only one-half of his wealth – to him (Antonio) for his own as well as
        Lorenzo's need – provided that he keeps two promises. First, Shylock has to sign an agreement bequeathing all
        his remaining property to Lorenzo and Jessica, which is to become effective after his demise, and second, he is
        to immediately convert to Christianity. Shylock is forced to agree to these terms, and he exits citing illness.
        <br>
        <b> Historical background </b> In Shakespeare's time, no Jews had been legally present in England for several
        hundred years (since the Edict of Expulsion in 1290). However, stereotypes of Jews as money lenders remained
        from the Middle Ages. Historically, money-lending had been a fairly common occupation among Jews, in part
        because Christians were not able to offer interest-bearing loans, then considered the sin of usury, and Jews
        were excluded from many fields of work.[3] At the same time, most Christian kings forbade Jews to own land for
        farming or to serve in the government, and craft guilds usually refused to admit Jews as artisans.[4] Thus
        money-lending was one of the few occupations still open to Jews.

        Hyam Maccoby argues that the play is based on medieval morality plays, exemplum, in which the Virgin Mary (here
        represented by Portia) argues for the forgiveness of human souls, as against the implacable accusations of the
        Devil (Shylock).

        OVERLORDSHIP. the position or authority of a suzerain.

        the domain or area subject to a suzerain. the position, power, or dignity of a suzerain

        the relationship between suzerain and subject. Suzerainty includes the rights and obligations of a person, state
        or other polity which controls the foreign policy and relations of a tributary state, but allows the tributary
        state internal autonomy.[1][2] While the subordinate party is called a vassal, vassal state or tributary state,
        the dominant party is called a suzerain. The rights and obligations of a vassal are called vassalage, and the
        rights and obligations of a suzerain are called suzerainty.

        Suzerainty differs from sovereignty in that the dominant power allows tributary states to be technically
        independent, but enjoy only limited self-rule. Although the situation has existed in a number of historical
        empires, it is considered difficult to reconcile with 20th- or 21st-century concepts of international law, in
        which sovereignty is a binary concept, which either exists or does not. While a sovereign state can agree by
        treaty to become a protectorate of a stronger power, modern international law does not recognise any way of
        making this relationship compulsory on the weaker power. Suzerainty is a practical, de facto situation, rather
        than a legal, de jure one. </p>

        culture or organization. Taboos are often meant to protect the individual, but there are other reasons
        for their development. The meaning of the word taboo has been somewhat expanded in the social
        sciences to strong prohibitions relating to any area of human activity or custom that is sacred or
        forbidden based on moral judgment, religious beliefs, or cultural norms. Restrictions. Kisi cheez ko

        or bequeathed by a will or testament. What Is a Testamentary Will?
        A testamentary will is a traditional will, aka last will and testament. It is a legal document that is used to
        transfer holdings in an estate to other people or organizations after the death of the person who makes
        the will, officially known as the testator. Testamentary wills are also used to appoint guardians for minor
        children, name the executors who carry out the will's directions, and set up trusts for beneficiaries. Any
        person over the age of majority who is of sound mind can legally draft a will.
        KEY TAKEAWAYS
        A testamentary will, aka a traditional last will and testament, is a legal document used to transfer a
        person's assets to beneficiaries after death.
        To be valid, testamentary wills must contain certain language, indicating who is making the will and
        revoking all previous wills, and must be signed.
        Although anyone can write a will, it's usually advisable to have a trust and estates lawyer draft or at least
        review it, to make sure it is worded correctly, precisely, and in accordance with state laws.
        If you die intestate—that is, without a will—a probate court decides the dispersal of your assets, based
        on state intestacy laws.
        Wills, along with trusts, are a key tool of estate planning and a way to transfer wealth.
        How a Testamentary Will Works
        Testamentary wills must contain: a clear indication that the testator is the maker of the will; a statement
        by the testator that they revoke any previous wills or codicils; a statement by the testator that
        demonstrates that they are of sound and mind and not under duress to dispose of the property; and a
        signature at the end of the will.
        An executor is selected by the testator to be in charge of the estate upon their death and to execute the
        terms of the will. The will can also designate the disposition of specific items, properties, and assets.
        Those who receive portions of the estate—property, assets, or other bequests—are known as
        the beneficiaries.
        Although anyone can write up a will, it's usually advisable to have a trust and estates lawyer do so, or at
        least review it, to make sure it is worded correctly, precisely, and in accordance with state
        laws. Holographic wills, handwritten and testator-signed documents that are not witnessed or notarized,
        are only acceptable in certain states.
        Testamentary Will: What it is, How it Works, FAQ (investopedia.com)
        What does Testamentary documents mean?
        A will, a draft of a will, written instructions for a will made by or at the requests of, under the
        instructions of, the testator, and any document purporting to be evidence of the contents, or to be a
        copy; of a will which is alleged to have been lost or destroyed.
        The phrase "testamentary documents" replaces the phrase "testamentary script" in CPR 57.1(2)(c). The
        testamentary documents are required to be lodged with the court in a probate claim: see CPR 57.5.

        testament or will: as a testamentary guardian, letters testamentary, etc. A paper, instrument,
        document, gift, appointment. etc., is said to be “testamentary” when it is written or made so as not to
        take effect until after the death of the person making it, and to be revocable and retain the property
        under his control during his life, although he may have believed that it would operate as an instrument
        of a different character. Sweet.

        an executor to administer an estate. Letters of testamentary allow the executor of an estate to serve as a

        is that one not only rebels against one's Lord but also imposes one's own will (in disregard
        of the Will of God - Ed.) on God's world and God's creatures. Anyone who reaches such a
        point is termed taghut and no one can be a true believer in God unless the authority of such
        a taghut (evil one) is rejected.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Here taghut see( n. 286) above has a plural connotation. It implies that by turning away
        from God a man is subjected not to the tyranny of one, but to the tyranny of many tawaghit
        (evil one). One of these is Satan, who throws up new temptations and allurements. Another
        potential taghut (transgressor) is man's own animal self, which seeks to subjugate him to his
        appetites and desires. There are many more taghut in the world outside oneself ; one's wife
        and children, one's relatives, one's family and one's community, one's friends and
        acquaintances, one's social environment and one's people, one's leaders and guides, one's
        government and rulers are all potential taghut, each one of whom seeks to have his
        purposes served. Man remains subjected to these innumerable masters throughout his life,
        not knowing precisely whom he should please and whose displeasure he should avoid.</p>

        truism. An example of such a sentence would be "Under appropriate conditions, the sun rises." Without
        contextual support – a statement of what those appropriate conditions are – the sentence is true but
        incontestable.

    <p> By repeatedly trying to make someone miserable you torment them. The noun torment is the result of the verb
        torment.

        After stealing the old lady's purse, you might expect to be tormented by many sleepless nights. Those nights
        without sleep will torment (tor-MENT) you. They are your torment (TOR-ment). Perhaps you shouldn't have done
        that. You'll doubtless notice the relationship between torture and torment. But the subtle difference between
        them is that to torment someone is to torture them repeatedly. Often this is used metaphorically. For example,
        calling someone over and over to demand payment isn't actually torture, but it's certainly a way to torment
        them. </p>

        When you encounter the word tribulation, it will usually be in the company of the word trial as in, “She
        suffered many trials and tribulations as an early feminist.” The two words, while not identical, emphasize each
        other as they essentially mean testing and suffering. Tribulation comes from the Latin verb tribulare "to

    <br>
    <p> ‘Undernourishment’ is the main indicator used by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations to
        measure the extent of food supplies and nutrition. It is often used interchangeably with the term ‘hunger’.

        Undernourishment is solely determined by the sufficiency of energy (calorie) intake. It does not consider the
        quality or diversity of someone’s diet. That means it is only one component of malnutrition: a broader term that
        also captures other types of nutrient deficiencies, such as micronutrients.

        The prevalence of undernourishment in any given country or region measures the share of the population that has
        a daily food intake that is insufficient to provide, on average, the amount of dietary energy required to
        maintain a normal, active and healthy life. That is, the share of people who do not get enough calories to live
        a healthy life. How is undernourishment measured?
        To judge whether someone was undernourished we would need to know two things:

        How many calories they consume;
        How many calories they need to maintain a healthy life.
        This might be easy for a known individual, but measuring this across a whole population is more difficult.

        The amount of calories that people need can be very different: factors such as someone’s height, weight, sex,
        age, and activity levels will mean that some people need more calories than others.

        The amount of calories that people consume also varies widely – some people eat more than their requirements –
        which can lead to obesity – while others eat well below their requirements.

        This means we cannot simply calculate undernourishment from an average of calorie consumption and requirements.

        To take account of this, the UN FAO address inequalities using three factors: 1:

        They estimate the average availability of calories (energy) across the population.
        They measure the levels of inequalities in food consumption within a population. This is called the Coefficient
        of Variation (CV) of energy intake. This metric is shown in the map. As we see, this value varies from country
        to country depending on the inequalities in food supply.
        They use demographic information – such as age structure, sex, height, and activity levels – for each country to
        assess the distribution of energy requirements. This means the ‘minimum energy requirement’ for each country is
        slightly different, as shown on the map.
        Using these three factors, they then calculate undernourishment using a ‘parametric probability density
        function’. This indicates the cumulative probability across a population that someone has a daily energy intake
        that is lower than the minimum requirements.

        This undernourishment measure, therefore, does not tell us anything about what specific individuals are
        undernourished. But it gives us an estimate of what share of a population does not get enough calories to eat.

        you get the idea.

        Knowing that the "un-" prefix turns a word into its opposite, you'll see that unseemly means "not seemly." Let's
        look at that word (which is related to our verb seem), because it carries the real meaning. Seemly goes back to
        around 1200, to the Old Norse word soemr, "fitting, becoming." The negative "un-" was added in the early 14th
        century to denote the opposite meaning. "Seems" to make sense, doesn’t it? </p>

        Something that causes people to be treated cruelly and unfairly especially by taking away their freedom.
        The Yoke of Jesus
        When Jesus said, “Take my yoke upon you” (Matthew 11:29), He meant that we are to submit ourselves
        to Him every day in every way. A yoke was made of wood, hand-carved to fit the neck and shoulders of
        the animal to prevent pain or discomfort. In ancient culture, the word yoke was a term that was used to
        describe submission. So when someone was described as being yoked to someone or something, it was
        communicating the idea that he or she was in submission to that person or thing.
        In Jeremiah 27:2 ; 28:10,12the word in the Authorized Version rendered "yoke" is motah , which
        properly means a "staff," or as in the Revised Version, "bar."
        These words in the Hebrew are both used figuratively of severe bondage, or affliction, or subjection
        ( Leviticus 26:13 ; 1 Kings 12:4 ; Isaiah 47:6 ; Lamentations 1:14 ; 3:27 ). In the New Testament the word
        "yoke" is also used to denote servitude ( Matthew 11:29 Matthew 11:30 ; Acts 15:10 ; Galatians 5:1 ).
